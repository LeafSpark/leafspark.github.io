The Shire is a fictional region in J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium, which first appeared in his novel The Hobbit and was further developed in The Lord of the Rings. It is the homeland of the Hobbits and the setting for the early part of The Lord of the Rings. The Shire is described as a pastoral, idyllic region, with rolling hills, forests, and a gentle, relatively unchanging way of life.

The Shire is divided into four Farthings - the North, South, East, and West Farthings - each with its own towns and villages. The largest and most important town in the Shire is Hobbiton, home to Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. Other notable locations include Tuckborough, the ancestral home of the Took family, and Michel Delving, the chief town of the West Farthing and the site of the Shire's only newspaper, the Shire Times.

The Shire is characterized by its peaceful, rural nature, with Hobbits living in cozy, earth-covered holes called smials and engaging in activities like farming, gardening, and drinking ale at the local inn. The Shire is largely untouched by the wider events of Middle-earth, with Hobbits generally uninterested in the affairs of Men, Elves, and Dwarves. This changes, however, when the hobbit Frodo Baggins is tasked with destroying the One Ring, setting in motion the events of The Lord of the Rings.

Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the quantum scale, that is, the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

Classical physics, the collection of theories that were developed from the Renaissance through the late 19th century, describes many aspects of nature at an ordinary (macroscopic) scale, but is incapable of explaining the behavior of matter and energy at the quantum (microscopic) scale. Most of the success of modern technology can be traced to the development of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century and its subsequent applications.

Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, matter, and electromagnetic radiation exhibit particle-like and wave-like properties. This means that, at the quantum scale, matter and energy can exhibit properties of both particles and waves. This dual nature is known as wave-particle duality. Quantum mechanics also differs from classical physics in that it does not have a clear description of the cause-and-effect relationship between variables, but rather describes the probabilities of variables.

The Parthenon is a former temple on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece, dedicated to the goddess Athena, whom the people of Athens considered their patron. Construction began in 447 BC when the Athenian Empire was at the peak of its power. It was completed in 438 BC although decoration of the building continued until 432 BC. It is the most important surviving building of Classical Greece, generally considered the culmination of the development of the Doric order.

The Parthenon is regarded as an enduring symbol of Ancient Greece, Athenian democracy, and one of the world's greatest cultural monuments. To the Athenians who built it, the Parthenon, and other Acropolis monuments, were seen as a great celebration of Hellenic victory over the Persian invaders and as a thanksgiving to the gods for that victory.

The temple is in the Doric architectural style, with a rectangular footprint and a colonnade of Doric columns supporting a frieze and triangular pediments at each end. The decorative sculptures that originally covered the exterior and interior of the temple were once considered the high point of Greek art. The sculptures and some architectural elements are now housed in various museums, notably the Acropolis Museum and the British Museum.

The Battle of Stalingrad was a major battle on the Eastern Front of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad, now Volgograd, in Southern Russia. The battle took place between July 23, 1942, and February 2, 1943. It was the largest confrontation of World War II, with the movements of more than 2 million soldiers, 800,000 on the Axis side and 1,300,000 on the Soviet side. The heavy losses inflicted on the German forces marked the major turning point of the war.

The battle is notorious for its brutality and disregard for civilian casualties. The battle opened with a Luftwaffe bombing campaign that reduced much of the city to rubble. The battle then degenerated into house-to-house fighting, with both sides suffering enormous casualties. The Germans eventually managed to capture most of the city, but were unable to dislodge the Soviets from the western bank of the Volga River. In November 1942, the Soviets launched a massive counteroffensive, encircling and trapping the Axis forces in the city. After months of fierce fighting, the Axis forces in Stalingrad surrendered on February 2, 1943.

The Battle of Stalingrad was a major strategic and symbolic victory for the Soviets. It marked the first major defeat of the German military and the turning point on the Eastern Front. The battle resulted in immense casualties, with estimates of total Axis deaths ranging from 850,000 to 1.5 million, and Soviet deaths estimated at 1.1 million. The battle is considered one of the bloodiest battles in human history.

The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BCE, with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BCE. Other stretches were built later and maintained over the centuries. The Great Wall is generally referred to in the singular, although it is actually a series of multiple walls.

The Great Wall stretches from Shanhaiguan in the east to Lop Nur in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia. It has a total length of about 13,170 miles (21,196 km). The best-known and best-preserved sections of the Great Wall were built during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). These walls were built of rammed earth, stone, and brick, and ran along the crests of hills and mountains.

The Great Wall was built to help protect ancient Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of nomadic groups from the northern steppe. The defense system consisted of walls, garrison stations, watch towers, and smoke signals. While the wall did succeed in warding off northern nomadic invasions to some extent, it did not succeed in preventing the Mongols from invading China in the 13th century.

Today, the Great Wall is one of the most popular tourist destinations in China, drawing over 10 million visitors per year.

On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that started in 2014. The invasion became the largest attack on a European country since World War II.121314 It is estimated to have caused tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties and hundreds of thousands of military casualties. By June 2022, Russian troops occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory. From a population of 41 million in January 2022, about 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced and more than 8.2 million had fled the country by April 2023, creating Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. Extensive environmental damage caused by the war, widely described as an ecocide, contributed to food crises worldwide.

Before the invasion, Russian troops massed near Ukraine's borders as Russian officials denied any plans to attack. Russian president Vladimir Putin announced a "special military operation" to support the Russian-backed breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose paramilitary forces had been fighting Ukraine in the Donbas conflict since 2014. Putin espoused irredentist views challenging Ukraine's right to exist, and falsely claimed that Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis persecuting the Russian minority. He said his goal was to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine. Russian air strikes and a ground invasion were launched at a northern front from Belarus towards Kyiv, a southern front from Crimea, and an eastern front from the Donbas and towards Kharkiv. Ukraine enacted martial law, ordered a general mobilisation and severed diplomatic relations with Russia.

Russian troops retreated from the northern front by April 2022 after encountering logistical challenges and stiff Ukrainian resistance. On the southern and southeastern fronts, Russia captured Kherson in March and Mariupol in May after a destructive siege. Russia launched a renewed offensive in the Donbas and continued to bomb military and civilian targets far from the front line, including the energy grid through the winter. In late 2022, Ukraine launched successful counteroffensives in the south and east. Soon after, Russia announced the illegal annexation of four partly occupied regions. In November, Ukraine retook parts of Kherson Oblast, including the city of Kherson itself. In June 2023, Ukraine launched another counteroffensive in the southeast, which by the end of the year had petered out with only small amounts of territory retaken.

The invasion was met with international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal in March 2022. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus, and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The Baltic states all declared Russia a terrorist state. Protests occurred around the world, along with mass arrests of anti-war protesters in Russia, which also enacted a law enabling greater media censorship. Over 1,000 companies closed their operations in Russia and Belarus as a result of the invasion. The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened investigations into possible crimes against humanity, war crimes, abduction of children, and genocide. The court issued four arrest warrants in that regard: for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova in March 2023, alleging responsibility for the unlawful deportation of children, as well as for commanders Sergey Kobylash and Viktor Sokolov in 2024, alleging war crimes.15

Background
Main article: Russia–Ukraine relations
International treaties
In return for security guarantees, Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1994, agreeing to dismantle the nuclear weapons the former USSR had left in Ukraine.16 Russia, the UK and the US agreed in the Budapest Memorandum to uphold Ukraine's territorial integrity.17 In 1999, Russia signed the Charter for European Security, affirming the right of each state "to choose or change its security arrangements" and join alliances.18 In 2002, Putin said that Ukraine's growing relations with NATO were no concern of Russia.19

However, when Ukraine and Georgia sought to join NATO in 2008, Putin warned that their membership would be a threat to Russia.20 Some NATO members worried about antagonising Russia.21 At the 2008 Bucharest summit, NATO refused to offer Ukraine and Georgia membership, but Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Secretary General of NATO, also issued a statement that they would join one day.22 Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would do everything it could to prevent this.23 Putin claimed that NATO members had promised in 1990 not to let Eastern European countries join. That statement is disputed.24

In 2013, Ukraine's parliament overwhelmingly approved finalising an association agreement with the European Union (EU).25 Russia had put pressure on Ukraine to reject it.26 Kremlin adviser Sergei Glazyev warned in September 2013 that if Ukraine signed the EU agreement, Russia would no longer acknowledge Ukraine's borders.27 In November, Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych suddenly withdrew from signing the agreement,28 choosing closer ties to the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union instead. This coerced withdrawal triggered a wave of protests known as Euromaidan, culminating in the Revolution of Dignity in February 2014. Yanukovych was removed from power by parliament and fled to Russia.


Russian-backed separatist forces during the War in Donbas in 2015
Since 23 February 2014 Pro-Russian unrest followed in eastern and southern Ukraine. Russian soldiers with no insignia occupied the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, and seized the Crimean Parliament.29 Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014, after a widely disputed referendum. The war in Donbas began in April 2014 when armed Russian-backed separatists seized Ukrainian government buildings and proclaimed the independent Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic.3031 Russian troops were directly involved in these conflicts.32 The ceasefires of the Minsk agreements, signed in September 2014 and February 2015 in a bid to stop the fighting, repeatedly failed.33 A dispute emerged over the role of Russia: Normandy Format members France, Germany, and Ukraine saw Minsk as an agreement between Russia and Ukraine, but Russia insisted Ukraine should negotiate directly with the two separatist republics.3435

The annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas sparked a wave of Russian nationalism and Russian fascism, with calls to annex more Ukrainian land for Novorossiya (New Russia).36 Analyst Vladimir Socor called Putin's 2014 speech following the annexation a "manifesto of Greater-Russia Irredentism".37 Putin utilised the Kosovo independence precedent and NATO bombing of Yugoslavia as a justification for his involvement in the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas.38394041

Finally, on December 23, 2014 (i.e. after the Russian annexation of Crimea), the Ukrainian parliament voted to remove the neutrality clause from the Constitution of Ukraine and to actively seek Ukraine's membership in NATO.4243

Russian military build-up around Ukraine as of 3 December 2021
There was a massive Russian military build-up near the Ukraine border in March and April 2021,44 and again in both Russia and Belarus from October 2021 onward.45 Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine, with denials being issued up to the day before the invasion.464748 The decision to invade Ukraine was reportedly made by Putin and a small group of war hawks or siloviki in Putin's inner circle, including national security adviser Nikolai Patrushev and defence minister Sergei Shoigu.49

In July 2021, Putin published an essay "On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians", in which he called Ukraine "historically Russian lands" and claimed there is "no historical basis" for the "idea of Ukrainian people as a nation separate from the Russians".5051 Days before the invasion, Putin claimed that Ukraine never had "real statehood" and that modern Ukraine was a mistake created by the Russian Bolsheviks.52 American historian Timothy Snyder described Putin's ideas as imperialism.53 British journalist Edward Lucas described it as historical revisionism. Other observers found that Russia's leadership held a distorted view of Ukraine, as well as of its own history,54 and that these distortions were propagated through the state.55

During the second build-up, Russia demanded that NATO end all activity in Eastern Europe and ban Ukraine or any former Soviet state from ever joining NATO.56 Russia threatened an unspecified military response if NATO followed an "aggressive line."57 These demands were widely seen as non-viable; Eastern European states have willingly joined NATO for security reasons, and their governments sought protection from Russian irredentism.58 A treaty to prevent Ukraine joining would go against NATO's "open door" policy, despite NATO's unenthusiastic response to Ukrainian requests to join.59 NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that "Russia has no say" on whether Ukraine joins, and that "Russia has no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbours."60 NATO's official policy is that it does not seek confrontation, and NATO and Russia had co-operated until Russia annexed Crimea.61 NATO offered to improve communication with Russia to discuss missile placements and military exercises, as long as Russia withdrew troops from Ukraine's borders,62 but Russia did not do so.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz both made efforts in February 2022 to prevent war.63 Macron met Putin but failed to dissuade him from the invasion. Scholz warned Putin heavy sanctions would be imposed should he invade, and told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to declare Ukraine a neutral state and renounce its aspirations to join NATO. Zelenskyy replied that Putin could not be trusted to uphold such a settlement.64 Ukraine had been a neutral country in 2014 when Russia occupied Crimea and invaded the Donbas.6566 On 19 February, Zelenskyy made a speech at the Munich Security Conference, calling for Western powers to drop their policy of "appeasement" towards Moscow and implement a clear time-frame for when Ukraine could join NATO.67

Putin's invasion announcement
Main article: On conducting a special military operation
On 21 February, Putin announced Russian diplomatic recognition of the Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine as independent states: the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. The following day, Russia announced that it was sending troops into these territories as "peacekeepers",68 and the Federation Council of Russia authorised the use of military force abroad.69

Putin's address to the nation on 24 February 2022. Minutes after Putin's announcement, the invasion began.
Before 5 a.m. Kyiv time on 24 February, Putin in another speech announced, a "special military operation", which "effectively declared war on Ukraine."7071 Putin said the operation was to "protect the people" of the Russian-controlled breakaway republics. He falsely claimed that they had "been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime."72 Putin also falsely claimed that Ukrainian government officials were neo-Nazis under Western control, that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons, and that NATO was building up military infrastructure in Ukraine to threaten Russia.73 He said Russia sought the "demilitarisation and denazification" of Ukraine, and espoused views challenging Ukraine's right to exist.7475 Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukraine and supported the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination.73 Russian missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine,76 and Russian troops invaded from the north, east, and south.77 Russia did not officially declare war.78 Reports of an alleged leak of Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) documents by US intelligence sources said that the FSB had not been aware of Putin's plan to invade Ukraine.79

Strength
The strength of Russian invading forces, including Russia-controlled "people's militias" of DPR and LPR, is estimated at 190,000 personnel. The strength of Russian forces fighting at 24 February 2024 is estimated at 500,000.80

Military control around Kyiv on 2 April 2022
The invasion, described as the biggest attack on a European country since the Second World War, began at dawn on 24 February.7081 Russia launched a simultaneous ground and air campaign, commencing air and missile strikes across Ukraine,8283 with some rockets reaching as far west as Lviv.84 It is Russia's largest combined arms operation since the Battle of Berlin in 1945.85 Fighting began in Luhansk Oblast at 3:40 a.m. Kyiv time near Milove on the border with Russia.86 The main infantry and tank attacks were launched in four spearheads, creating a northern front launched towards Kyiv from Belarus, a southern front from Crimea, a southeastern front from Russian-controlled Donbas, and an eastern front from Russia towards Kharkiv and Sumy.87 Russian vehicles were subsequently marked with a white Z military symbol (a non-Cyrillic letter), believed to be a measure to prevent friendly fire.88

Immediately after the invasion began, Zelenskyy declared martial law in Ukraine.89 The same evening, he ordered a general mobilisation of all Ukrainian males between 18 and 60 years old,90 prohibiting them from leaving the country.91 Wagner Group mercenaries and Kadyrovites contracted by the Kremlin reportedly made several attempts to assassinate Zelenskyy, including an operation involving several hundred mercenaries meant to infiltrate Kyiv with the aim of killing the Ukrainian president.92 The Ukrainian government said anti-war officials within Russia's FSB shared the plans with them.93

The Russian invasion was unexpectedly met by fierce Ukrainian resistance.94 In Kyiv, Russia failed to take the city and was repulsed in the battles of Irpin, Hostomel, and Bucha. The Russians tried to encircle the capital, but its defenders under Oleksandr Syrskyi held their ground, effectively using Western Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to thin Russian supply lines and stall the offensive.95

On the southern front, Russian forces had captured the regional capital of Kherson by 2 March. A column of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles was ambushed on 9 March in Brovary and sustained heavy losses that forced them to retreat.96 The Russian army adopted siege tactics on the western front around the key cities of Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv, but failed to capture them due to stiff resistance and logistical setbacks.97 In Mykolaiv Oblast, Russian forces advanced as far as Voznesensk, but were repelled and pushed back south of Mykolaiv. On 25 March, the Russian Defence Ministry stated that the first stage of the "military operation" in Ukraine was "generally complete", that the Ukrainian military forces had suffered serious losses, and the Russian military would now concentrate on the "liberation of Donbas."98 The "first stage" of the invasion was conducted on four fronts, including one towards western Kyiv from Belarus by the Russian Eastern Military District, comprising the 29th, 35th, and 36th Combined Arms Armies. A second axis, deployed towards eastern Kyiv from Russia by the Central Military District (northeastern front), comprised the 41st Combined Arms Army and the 2nd Guards Combined Arms Army.99

A third axis was deployed towards Kharkiv by the Western Military District (eastern front), with the 1st Guards Tank Army and 20th Combined Arms Army. A fourth, southern front originating in occupied Crimea and Russia's Rostov oblast with an eastern axis towards Odesa and a western area of operations toward Mariupol was opened by the Southern Military District, including the 58th, 49th, and 8th Combined Arms Army, the latter also commanding the 1st and 2nd Army Corps of the Russian separatist forces in Donbas.99 By 7 April, Russian troops deployed to the northern front by the Russian Eastern Military District pulled back from the Kyiv offensive, reportedly to resupply and redeploy to the Donbas region in an effort to reinforce the renewed invasion of southeastern Ukraine. The northeastern front, including the Central Military District, was similarly withdrawn for resupply and redeployment to southeastern Ukraine.99100 On 26 April, delegates from the US and 40 allied nations met at Ramstein Air Base in Germany to discuss the formation of a coalition that would provide economic support in addition to military supplies and refitting to Ukraine.101 Following Putin's Victory Day speech in early May, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said no short term resolution to the invasion should be expected.102

Ukraine's reliance on Western-supplied equipment constrained operational effectiveness, as supplying countries feared that Ukraine would use Western-made matériel to strike targets in Russia.103 Military experts disagreed on the future of the conflict; some suggested that Ukraine should trade territory for peace,104 while others believed that Ukraine could maintain its resistance due to Russian losses.105

By 30 May, disparities between Russian and Ukrainian artillery were apparent, with Ukrainian artillery being vastly outgunned, in terms of both range and number.103 In response to US President Joe Biden's indication that enhanced artillery would be provided to Ukraine, Putin said that Russia would expand its invasion front to include new cities in Ukraine. In apparent retribution, Putin ordered a missile strike against Kyiv on 6 June after not directly attacking the city for several weeks.106 On 10 June 2022, deputy head of the SBU Vadym Skibitsky stated that during the Severodonetsk campaign, the frontlines were where the future of the invasion would be decided: "This is an artillery war now, and we are losing in terms of artillery. Everything now depends on what the west gives us. Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our western partners have given us about 10% of what they have."107

On 29 June, Reuters reported that US Intelligence Director Avril Haines, in an update of past U.S. intelligence assessments on the Russian invasion, said that U.S. intelligence agencies agree that the invasion will continue "for an extended period of time ... In short, the picture remains pretty grim and Russia's attitude toward the West is hardening."108 On 5 July, BBC reported that extensive destruction by the Russian invasion would cause immense financial damage to Ukraine's reconstruction economy, with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal telling nations at a reconstruction conference in Switzerland that Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan and Russian oligarchs should contribute to the cost.109

Initial invasion of Ukraine (24 February – 7 April)
For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (24 February – 7 April 2022).

Animated map of the Russian invasion from 24 February to 7 April 2022
The invasion began on 24 February, launched out of Belarus to target Kyiv, and from the northeast against the city of Kharkiv. The southeastern front was conducted as two separate spearheads, from Crimea and the southeast against Luhansk and Donetsk.

Kyiv and northern front

Russian efforts to capture Kyiv included a probative spearhead on 24 February, from Belarus south along the west bank of the Dnipro River. The apparent intent was to encircle the city from the west, supported by two separate axes of attack from Russia along the east bank of the Dnipro: the western at Chernihiv, and from the east at Sumy. These were likely intended to encircle Kyiv from the northeast and east.8283

Russia tried to seize Kyiv quickly, with Spetsnaz infiltrating into the city supported by airborne operations and a rapid mechanised advance from the north, but failed.110111 The United States contacted Zelenskyy and offered to help him flee the country, lest the Russian Army attempt to kidnap or kill him on seizing Kyiv; Zelenskyy responded that "The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride."112 The Washington Post, which described the quote as "one of the most-cited lines of the Russian invasion", was not entirely sure of the comment's accuracy. Reporter Glenn Kessler said it came from "a single source, but on the surface it appears to be a good one."113 Russian forces advancing on Kyiv from Belarus gained control of the ghost town of Chernobyl.114 Russian Airborne Forces attempted to seize two key airfields near Kyiv, launching an airborne assault on Antonov Airport,115 and a similar landing at Vasylkiv, near Vasylkiv Air Base, on 26 February.116

By early March, Russian advances along the west side of the Dnipro were limited by Ukrainian defences.8382 As of 5 March, a large Russian convoy, reportedly 64 kilometres (40 mi) long, had made little progress toward Kyiv.117 The London-based think tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) assessed Russian advances from the north and east as "stalled."118 Advances from Chernihiv largely halted as a siege began there. Russian forces continued to advance on Kyiv from the northwest, capturing Bucha, Hostomel, and Vorzel by 5 March,119120 though Irpin remained contested as of 9 March.121 By 11 March, the lengthy convoy had largely dispersed and taken cover.122 On 16 March, Ukrainian forces began a counter-offensive to repel Russian forces.123 Unable to achieve a quick victory in Kyiv, Russian forces switched their strategy to indiscriminate bombing and siege warfare.124125 On 25 March, a Ukrainian counter-offensive retook several towns to the east and west of Kyiv, including Makariv.126127 Russian troops in the Bucha area retreated north at the end of March. Ukrainian forces entered the city on 1 April.128 Ukraine said it had recaptured the entire region around Kyiv, including Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel, and uncovered evidence of war crimes in Bucha.129 On 6 April, NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said that the Russian "retraction, resupply, and redeployment" of their troops from the Kyiv area should be interpreted as an expansion of Putin's plans for Ukraine, by redeploying and concentrating his forces on eastern Ukraine.100 Kyiv was generally left free from attack apart from isolated missile strikes. One did occur while UN Secretary-General António Guterres was visiting Kyiv on 28 April to discuss the survivors of the siege of Mariupol with Zelenskyy. One person was killed and several were injured in the attack.130

Russian forces advanced into Chernihiv Oblast on 24 February and besieged its administrative capital. The next day Russian forces attacked and captured Konotop.131132 A separate advance into Sumy Oblast the same day attacked the city of Sumy, just 35 kilometres (22 mi) from the Russo-Ukrainian border. The advance bogged down in urban fighting, and Ukrainian forces successfully held the city, claiming more than 100 Russian armoured vehicles were destroyed and dozens of soldiers had been captured.133 Russian forces also attacked Okhtyrka, deploying thermobaric weapons.134

On 4 March, Frederick Kagan wrote that the Sumy axis was then "the most successful and dangerous Russian avenue of advance on Kyiv", and commented that the geography favoured mechanised advances as the terrain "is flat and sparsely populated, offering few good defensive positions."82 Travelling along highways, Russian forces reached Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv, on 4 March.8382 The Pentagon confirmed on 6 April that the Russian army had left Chernihiv Oblast, but Sumy Oblast remained contested.135 On 7 April, the governor of Sumy Oblast said that Russian troops were gone, but had left behind rigged explosives and other hazards.136

On 24 February, Russian forces took control of the North Crimean Canal. Troops used explosives to destroy the dam across the river, allowing Crimea to obtain water from the Dnieper, which had been cut off since 2014.137 On 26 February, the siege of Mariupol began as the attack moved east linking to separatist-held Donbas.134138 En route, Russian forces entered Berdiansk and captured it.139 On 1 March, Russian forces attacked Melitopol and nearby cities.140 On 25 February, Russian units from the DPR were fighting near Pavlopil as they moved on Mariupol.141 By evening, the Russian Navy began an amphibious assault on the coast of the Sea of Azov 70 kilometres (43 mi) west of Mariupol. A US defence official said that Russian forces were deploying thousands of marines from this beachhead.142

The Russian 22nd Army Corps approached the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on 26 February143 and besieged Enerhodar. A fire began,144145 but the Ukrainian military said that essential equipment was undamaged.146 A third Russian attack group from Crimea moved northwest and captured the bridge over the Dnieper.147 On 2 March, Russian troops took Kherson; this was the first major city to fall to Russian forces.148 Russian troops moved on Mykolaiv and attacked it two days later. They were repelled by Ukrainian forces.149 On 2 March, Ukrainian forces initiated a counter-offensive on Horlivka,150 controlled by the DPR.151

After renewed missile attacks on 14 March in Mariupol, the Ukrainian government said more than 2,500 had died.152 By 18 March, Mariupol was completely encircled and fighting reached the city centre, hampering efforts to evacuate civilians.153 On 20 March, an art school sheltering around 400 people, was destroyed by Russian bombs.154 The Russians demanded surrender, and the Ukrainians refused.87155 On 27 March, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna said that "(m)ore than 85 percent of the whole town is destroyed."156

Putin told Emmanuel Macron in a phone call on 29 March that the bombardment of Mariupol would only end when the Ukrainians surrendered.157 On 1 April, Russian troops refused safe passage into Mariupol to 50 buses sent by the United Nations to evacuate civilians, as peace talks continued in Istanbul.158 On 3 April, following the retreat of Russian forces from Kyiv, Russia expanded its attack on southern Ukraine further west, with bombardment and strikes against Odesa, Mykolaiv, and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.159160

Russian bombardment on the outskirts of Kharkiv, 1 March 2022
In the east, Russian troops attempted to capture Kharkiv, less than 35 kilometres (22 mi) from the Russian border,161 and met strong Ukrainian resistance. On 25 February, the Millerovo air base was attacked by Ukrainian military forces with OTR-21 Tochka missiles, which according to Ukrainian officials, destroyed several Russian Air Force planes and started a fire.84 On 1 March, Denis Pushilin, head of the DPR, announced that DPR forces had almost completely surrounded the city of Volnovakha.162 On 2 March, Russian forces were repelled from Sievierodonetsk during an attack against the city.163 Izium was captured by Russian forces on 1 April164 after a monthlong battle.165

On 25 March, the Russian defence ministry said it would seek to occupy major cities in eastern Ukraine.166 On 31 March, PBS News reported renewed shelling and missile attacks in Kharkiv, as bad or worse than before, as peace talks with Russia were to resume in Istanbul.167

Amid the heightened Russian shelling of Kharkiv on 31 March, Russia reported a helicopter strike against an oil supply depot approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi) north of the border in Belgorod, and accused Ukraine of the attack.168 Ukraine denied responsibility.169 By 7 April, the renewed massing of Russian invasion troops and tank divisions around the towns of Izium, Sloviansk, and Kramatorsk prompted Ukrainian government officials to advise the remaining residents near the eastern border of Ukraine to evacuate to western Ukraine within 2–3 days, given the absence of arms and munitions previously promised to Ukraine by then.170

Southeastern front (8 April – 5 September)
For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (8 April – 28 August 2022).

Animated map of the Russian invasion from 7 April to 5 September 2022
By 17 April, Russian progress on the southeastern front appeared to be impeded by opposing Ukrainian forces in the large, heavily fortified Azovstal steel mill and surrounding area in Mariupol.171

On 19 April, The New York Times confirmed that Russia had launched a renewed invasion front referred to as an "eastern assault" across a 480-kilometre (300 mi) front extending from Kharkiv to Donetsk and Luhansk, with simultaneous missile attacks again directed at Kyiv in the north and Lviv in western Ukraine.172 As of 30 April, a NATO official described Russian advances as "uneven" and "minor."173 An anonymous US Defence official called the Russian offensive "very tepid", "minimal at best", and "anaemic."174 In June 2022 the chief spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Defence Igor Konashenkov revealed that Russian troops were divided between the Army Groups "Centre" commanded by Colonel General Aleksander Lapin and "South" commanded by Army General Sergey Surovikin.175 On 20 July, Lavrov announced that Russia would respond to the increased military aid being received by Ukraine from abroad as justifying the expansion of its special military operation to include objectives in both the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.176

Russian Ground Forces started recruiting volunteer battalions from the regions in June 2022 to create a new 3rd Army Corps within the Western Military District, with a planned strength estimated at 15,500–60,000 personnel.177 Its units were deployed to the front around the time of Ukraine's 9 September Kharkiv oblast counteroffensive, in time to join the Russian retreat, leaving behind tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and personnel carriers: the 3rd Army Corps "melted away" according to Forbes, having little or no impact on the battlefield along with other irregular forces.178

Fall of Mariupol
Further information: Siege of Mariupol
On 13 April, Russian forces intensified their attack on the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works in Mariupol, and the remaining Ukrainian personnel defending it.179 By 17 April, Russian forces had surrounded the factory. Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal said that the Ukrainian soldiers had vowed to ignore the renewed ultimatum to surrender and to fight to the last soul.180 On 20 April, Putin said that the siege of Mariupol could be considered tactically complete, since the 500 Ukrainian troops entrenched in bunkers within the Azovstal iron works and estimated 1,000 Ukrainian civilians were completely sealed off from any type of relief.181

After consecutive meetings with Putin and Zelenskyy, UN Secretary-General Guterres on 28 April said he would attempt to organise an emergency evacuation of survivors from Azovstal in accordance with assurances he had received from Putin on his visit to the Kremlin.182 On 30 April, Russian troops allowed civilians to leave under UN protection.183 By 3 May, after allowing approximately 100 Ukrainian civilians to depart from the Azovstal steel factory, Russian troops renewed their bombardment of the steel factory.184 On 6 May, The Daily Telegraph reported that Russia had used thermobaric bombs against the remaining Ukrainian soldiers, who had lost contact with the Kyiv government; in his last communications, Zelenskyy authorised the commander of the besieged steel factory to surrender as necessary under the pressure of increased Russian attacks.185 On 7 May, the Associated Press reported that all civilians were evacuated from the Azovstal steel works at the end of the three-day ceasefire.186

After the last civilians evacuated from the Azovstal bunkers, nearly two thousand Ukrainian soldiers remained barricaded there, 700 of them injured. They were able to communicate a plea for a military corridor to evacuate, as they expected summary execution if they surrendered to Russian forces.187 Reports of dissent within the Ukrainian troops at Azovstal were reported by Ukrainska Pravda on 8 May indicating that the commander of the Ukrainian marines assigned to defend the Azovstal bunkers made an unauthorised acquisition of tanks, munitions, and personnel, broke out from the position there and fled. The remaining soldiers spoke of a weakened defensive position in Azovstal as a result, which allowed progress to advancing Russian lines of attack.188 Ilia Somolienko, deputy commander of the remaining Ukrainian troops barricaded at Azovstal, said: "We are basically here dead men. Most of us know this and it's why we fight so fearlessly."189

On 16 May, the Ukrainian General staff announced that the Mariupol garrison had "fulfilled its combat mission" and that final evacuations from the Azovstal steel factory had begun. The military said that 264 service members were evacuated to Olenivka under Russian control, while 53 of them who were "seriously injured" had been taken to a hospital in Novoazovsk also controlled by Russian forces.190191 Following the evacuation of Ukrainian personnel from Azovstal, Russian and DPR forces fully controlled all areas of Mariupol. The end of the battle also brought an end to the Siege of Mariupol. Russia press secretary Dmitry Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin had guaranteed that the fighters who surrendered would be treated "in accordance with international standards" while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an address that "the work of bringing the boys home continues, and this work needs delicacy—and time." Some prominent Russian lawmakers called on the government to deny prisoner exchanges for members of the Azov Regiment.192

Military control around Donbas as of 24 March 2023: pink highlights areas held by the DNR, LNR, and Russia, yellow highlights areas held by the Ukrainian government.
A Russian missile attack on Kramatorsk railway station in the city of Kramatorsk took place on 8 April, reportedly killing at least 52 people193 and injuring as many as 87 to 300.194 On 11 April, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine expected a major new Russian offensive in the east.195 American officials said that Russia had withdrawn or been repulsed elsewhere in Ukraine, and therefore was preparing a retraction, resupply, and redeployment of infantry and tank divisions to the southeastern Ukraine front.196197 Military satellites photographed extensive Russian convoys of infantry and mechanised units deploying south from Kharkiv to Izium on 11 April, apparently part of the planned Russian redeployment of its northeastern troops to the southeastern front of the invasion.198

On 18 April, with Mariupol almost entirely overtaken by Russian forces, the Ukrainian government announced that the second phase of the reinforced invasion of the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions had intensified with expanded invasion forces occupying of the Donbas.199

On 22 May, the BBC reported that after the fall of Mariupol, Russia had intensified offensives in Luhansk and Donetsk while concentrating missile attacks and intense artillery fire on Sievierodonetsk, the largest city under Ukrainian control in Luhansk province.200

On 23 May, Russian forces were reported entering the city of Lyman, fully capturing the city by 26 May.201202 Ukrainian forces were reported leaving Sviatohirsk.203 By 24 May, Russian forces captured the city of Svitlodarsk.204 On 30 May, Reuters reported that Russian troops had breached the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk.205 By 2 June, The Washington Post reported that Sievierodonetsk was on the brink of capitulation to Russian occupation with over 80 per cent of the city in the hands of Russian troops.206 On 3 June, Ukrainian forces reportedly began a counter-attack in Sievierodonetsk. By 4 June, Ukrainian government sources claimed 20% or more of the city had been recaptured.207

On 12 June, it was reported that possibly as many as 800 Ukrainian civilians (as per Ukrainian estimates) and 300–400 soldiers (as per Russian sources) were besieged at the Azot chemical factory in Severodonetsk.208209 With the Ukrainian defences of Severodonetsk faltering, Russian invasion troops began intensifying their attack upon the neighbouring city of Lysychansk as their next target city in the invasion.210 On 20 June it was reported that Russian troops continued to tighten their grip on Severodonetsk by capturing surrounding villages and hamlets surrounding the city, most recently the village of Metelkine.211

On 24 June, CNN reported that, amid continuing scorched-earth tactics being applied by advancing Russian troops, Ukraine's armed forces were ordered to evacuate the Severodonetsk; several hundred civilians taking refuge in the Azot chemical plant were left behind in the withdrawal, with some comparing their plight to that of the civilians at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol in May.212 On 3 July, CBS announced that the Russian defence ministry claimed that the city of Lysychansk had been captured and occupied by Russian forces.213 On 4 July, The Guardian reported that after the fall of the Luhansk oblast, that Russian invasion troops would continue their invasion into the adjacent Donetsk Oblast to attack the cities of Sloviansk and Bakhmut.214

On 14 April, Ukrainian troops reportedly blew up a bridge between Kharkiv and Izium used by Russian forces to redeploy troops to Izium, impeding the Russian convoy.215

On 5 May, David Axe writing for Forbes stated that the Ukrainian army had concentrated its 4th and 17th Tank Brigades and the 95th Air Assault Brigade around Izium for possible rearguard action against the deployed Russian troops in the area; Axe added that the other major concentration of Ukraine's forces around Kharkiv included the 92nd and 93rd Mechanised Brigades which could similarly be deployed for rearguard action against Russian troops around Kharkiv or link up with Ukrainian troops contemporaneously being deployed around Izium.216

On 13 May, BBC reported that Russian troops in Kharkiv were being retracted and redeployed to other fronts in Ukraine following the advances of Ukrainian troops into surrounding cities and Kharkiv itself, which included the destruction of strategic pontoon bridges built by Russian troops to cross over the Seversky Donets river and previously used for rapid tank deployment in the region.217

Missile attacks and bombardment of the key cities of Mykolaiv and Odesa continued as the second phase of the invasion began.172 On 22 April 2022, Russia's Brigadier General Rustam Minnekayev in a defence ministry meeting said that Russia planned to extend its Mykolaiv–Odesa front after the siege of Mariupol further west to include the breakaway region of Transnistria on the Ukrainian border with Moldova.218 The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine called this plan imperialism and said that it contradicted previous Russian claims that it did not have territorial ambitions in Ukraine and also that the statement admitted that "the goal of the 'second phase' of the war is not victory over the mythical Nazis, but simply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine."218 Georgi Gotev of EURACTIV noted on 22 April that Russian occupation from Odesa to Transnistria would transform Ukraine into a landlocked nation with no practical access to the Black Sea.219 Russia resumed its missile strikes on Odesa on 24 April, destroying military facilities and causing two dozen civilian casualties.220

Explosions destroyed two Russian broadcast towers in Transnistria on 27 April that had primarily rebroadcast Russian television programming, Ukrainian sources said.221 Russian missile attacks at the end of April destroyed runways in Odesa.222 In the week of 10 May, Ukrainian troops began to dislodge Russian forces from Snake Island in the Black Sea approximately 200 kilometres (120 mi) from Odesa.223 Russia said on 30 June 2022 that it had withdrawn its troops from the island, once their objectives had been completed.224

On 23 July, CNBC reported a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian port of Odesa, swiftly condemned by world leaders amid a recent U.N. and Turkish-brokered deal to secure a sea corridor for exports of grains and other foodstuffs.225 On 31 July, CNN reported significantly intensified rocket attacks and bombing of Mykolaiv by Russians, which also killed Ukrainian grain tycoon Oleksiy Vadaturskyi.226

French president Emmanuel Macron called the Russian missile attack on a shopping mall in Kremenchuk on 28 June 2022 a "war crime"
Russian forces continued to fire missiles and drop bombs on the key cities of Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia.172 Russian missiles destroyed the Dnipro International Airport on 10 April 2022.227 On 2 May, the UN, reportedly with the cooperation of Russian troops, evacuated about 100 survivors from the siege of Mariupol to the village of Bezimenne near Donetsk, from whence they would move to Zaporizhzhia.228 On 28 June, Reuters reported that a Russian missile attack on the city of Kremenchuk northwest of Zaporizhzhia detonated in a public mall and caused at least 18 deaths. France's Emmanuel Macron called it a "war crime."229

Ukrainian nuclear agency Energoatom called the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant "extremely tense", although it was still operated by its Ukrainian staff. As many as 500 Russian soldiers controlled the plant; Kyiv's nuclear agency said they were shelling nearby areas and storing weapons and "missile systems" there. Almost the entire country went on air raid alert. "They already shell the other side of the river Dnipro and the territory of Nikopol," Energoatom president Pedro Kotin said.230 Russia agreed on 19 August to allow IAEA inspectors access to the Zaporizhzhia plant after a phone call from Macron to Putin. As of July 2023, however, access to the plant remained limited and required extensive negotiation.231

Russia reported that 12 attacks with explosions from 50 artillery shells had been recorded by 18 August at the plant and the company town of Enerhodar.232 Tobias Ellwood, chair of the UK's Defence Select Committee, said on 19 August that any deliberate damage to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant that could cause radiation leaks would be a breach of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, under which an attack on a member state of NATO is an attack on them all. US congressman Adam Kinzinger said the following day that any radiation leak would kill people in NATO countries, an automatic activation of Article 5.233234


Killed Ukrainian civilians during the Zaporizhzhia civilian convoy attack by Russian Army in September 2022
Shelling hit coal ash dumps at the neighbouring coal-fired power station on 23 August, and the ash was on fire on 25 August. The 750 kV transmission line to the Dniprovska substation, the only one of the four 750 kV transmission lines still undamaged and cut by military action, passes over the ash dumps. At 12:12 p.m. on 25 August, the line was cut off due to the fire, disconnecting the plant and its two operating reactors from the national grid for the first time since its startup in 1985. In response, backup generators and coolant pumps for reactor 5 started up, and reactor 6 reduced generation.235

Incoming power was still available across the 330 kV line to the substation at the coal-fired station, so the diesel generators were not essential for cooling reactor cores and spent fuel pools. The 750 kV line and reactor 6 resumed operation at 12:29 p.m., but the line was cut by fire again two hours later. The line, but not the reactors, resumed operation again later that day.235 On 26 August, one reactor restarted in the afternoon and another in the evening, resuming electricity supplies to the grid.236 On 29 August 2022, an IAEA team led by Rafael Grossi went to the plant to investigate.237 Lydie Evrard and Massimo Aparo were also on the team. No leaks had been reported at the plant before their arrival, but shelling had occurred days before.238

On 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, beginning near Balakliia, led by General Syrskyi.239 An emboldened Kyiv launched a counteroffensive 12 September around Kharkiv successful enough to make Russia admit losing key positions and for The New York Times to say that it dented the image of a "Mighty Putin". Kiev sought more arms from the West to sustain the counteroffensive.240 On 21 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation and Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu said 300,000 reservists would be called.241 He also said that his country would use "all means" to "defend itself." Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said that the decision was predictable and that it was an attempt to justify "Russia's failures."242 British Foreign Office Minister Gillian Keegan called the situation an "escalation",243 while former Mongolian president Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj accused Russia of using Russian Mongols as "cannon fodder."244

Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts

In late September 2022, Russian-installed officials in Ukraine organised referendums on the annexation of the occupied territories of Ukraine. These included the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic in Russian occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, as well as the Russian-appointed military administrations of Kherson Oblast and Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Denounced by Ukraine's government and its allies as sham elections, the elections' official results showed overwhelming majorities in favour of annexation.245

On 30 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in an address to both houses of the Russian parliament.246 Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations all denounced the annexation as illegal.247

An IAEA delegation visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on 3 September, and on 6 September reported damage and security threats caused by external shelling and the presence of occupying troops in the plant.248 On 11 September, at 3:14 a.m., the sixth and final reactor was disconnected from the grid, "completely stopping" the plant. Energoatom said that preparations were "underway for its cooling and transfer to a cold state."249

In the early hours of 9 October 2022, Russian Armed Forces carried out an airstrike on a residential building in Zaporizhzhia, killing 13 civilians and injuring 89 others.250

On 29 August, Zelenskyy advisedly vowed the start of a full-scale counteroffensive in the southeast. He first announced a counteroffensive to retake Russian-occupied territory in the south concentrating on the Kherson-Mykolaiv region, a claim that was corroborated by the Ukrainian parliament as well as Operational Command South.251

On 4 September, Zelenskyy announced the liberation of two unnamed villages in Kherson Oblast and one in Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian authorities released a photo showing the raising of the Ukrainian flag in Vysokopillia by Ukrainian forces.252 Ukrainian attacks also continued along the southern frontline, though reports about territorial changes were largely unverifiable.253 On 12 September, Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian forces had retaken a total of 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) from Russia, in both the south and the east. The BBC stated that it could not verify these claims.254

In October, Ukrainian forces pushed further south towards the city of Kherson, taking control of 1,170 square kilometres (450 sq mi) of territory, with fighting extending to Dudchany.255256 On 9 November, defence minister Shoigu ordered Russian forces to leave part of Kherson Oblast, including the city of Kherson, and move to the eastern bank of the Dnieper.257 On 11 November, Ukrainian troops entered Kherson, as Russia completed its withdrawal. This meant that Russian forces no longer had a foothold on the west (right) bank of the Dnieper.258

Ukrainian forces launched another surprise counteroffensive on 6 September in the Kharkiv region near Balakliia led by General Syrskyi.239 By 7 September, Ukrainian forces had advanced some 20 kilometres (12 mi) into Russian occupied territory and claimed to have recaptured approximately 400 square kilometres (150 sq mi). Russian commentators said this was likely due to the relocation of Russian forces to Kherson in response to the Ukrainian offensive there.259 On 8 September, Ukrainian forces captured Balakliia and advanced to within 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) of Kupiansk.260 Military analysts said Ukrainian forces appeared to be moving towards Kupiansk, a major railway hub, with the aim of cutting off the Russian forces at Izium from the north.261

On 9 September, the Russian occupation administration of Kharkiv Oblast announced it would "evacuate" the civilian populations of Izium, Kupiansk and Velykyi Burluk. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said it believed Kupiansk would likely fall in the next 72 hours,262 while Russian reserve units were sent to the area by both road and helicopter.263 On the morning of 10 September, photos emerged claiming to depict Ukrainian troops raising the Ukrainian flag in the centre of Kupiansk,264 and the ISW said Ukrainian forces had captured approximately 2,500 square kilometres (970 sq mi) by effectively exploiting their breakthrough.265 Later in the day, Reuters reported that Russian positions in northeast Ukraine had "collapsed" in the face of the Ukrainian assault, with Russian forces forced to withdraw from their base at Izium after being cut off by the capture of Kupiansk.266

By 15 September, an assessment by UK's Ministry of Defence confirmed that Russia had either lost or withdrawn from almost all of their positions west of the Oskil river. The retreating units had also abandoned various high-value military assets.267 The offensive continued pushing east and by 2 October, Ukrainian Armed Forces had liberated another key city in the Second Battle of Lyman.268

After the end of the twin Ukrainian counteroffensives, the fighting shifted to a semi-deadlock during the winter,269 with heavy casualties but reduced motion of the frontline.270 Russia launched a self-proclaimed winter offensive in eastern Ukraine, but the campaign ended in "disappointment" for Moscow, with limited gains as the offensive stalled.269271 Analysts variously blamed the failure on Russia's lack of "trained men", and supply problems with artillery ammunition, among other problems.269271 Near the end of May, Mark Galeotti assessed that "after Russia's abortive and ill-conceived winter offensive, which squandered its opportunity to consolidate its forces, Ukraine is in a relatively strong position."272

On 7 February, The New York Times reported that Russians had newly mobilised nearly 200,000 soldiers to participate in the offensive in the Donbas, against Ukraine troops already wearied by previous fighting.273 The Russian private military company Wagner Group took on greater prominence in the war,274 leading "grinding advances" in Bakhmut with tens of thousands of recruits from prison battalions taking part in "near suicidal" assaults on Ukrainian positions.271

In late January 2023, fighting intensified in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.275 In nearby southern parts of Donetsk Oblast, an intense, three-week Russian assault near the coal-mining town of Vuhledar was called the largest tank battle of the war to date, and ended in disaster for Russian forces, who lost "at least 130 tanks and armored personnel carriers" according to Ukrainian commanders. The British Ministry of Defence stated that "a whole Russian brigade was effectively annihilated."276277

View of western Bakhmut during the battle, 5 April 2023
Following defeat in Kherson and Kharkiv, Russian and Wagner forces have focused on taking the city of Bakhmut and breaking the half year long stalemate that has prevailed there since the start of the war. Russian forces have sought to encircle the city, attacking from the north via Soledar. After taking heavy casualties, Russian and Wagner forces took control of Soledar on 16 January 2023.278279 By early February 2023, Bakhmut was facing attacks from north, south and east, with the sole Ukrainian supply lines coming from Chasiv Yar to the west.280

On 3 March 2023, Ukrainian soldiers destroyed two key bridges, creating the possibility for a controlled fighting withdrawal from eastern sectors of Bakhmut.281 On 4 March, Bakhmut's deputy mayor told news services that there was street fighting in the city.282 On 7 March, despite the city's near-encirclement, The New York Times reported that Ukrainian commanders were requesting permission from Kyiv to continue fighting against the Russians in Bakhmut.283

On 26 March, Wagner Group forces claimed to have fully captured the tactically significant Azom factory in Bakhmut.284 Appearing before the House Committee on Armed Services on 29 March, General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reported that, "for about the last 20, 21 days, the Russia have not made any progress whatsoever in and around Bakhmut." Milley described the severe casualties being inflicted upon the Russian forces there as a "slaughter-fest."285

By the beginning of May, the ISW assessed that Ukraine controlled only 1.89 square kilometres (0.73 sq mi) of the city, less than five percent.286 On 18 May 2023, The New York Times reported that Ukrainian forces had launched a local counteroffensive, taking back swathes of territory to the north and south of Bakhmut over the course of a few days.287

Flood in Kherson Oblast on 10 June 2023 caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam on 6 June 2023
In June 2023, Ukrainian forces gradually launched a series of counteroffensives on multiple fronts, including Donetsk Oblast, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and others.288 On 8 June 2023, counteroffensive efforts focused near settlements such as Orikhiv, Tokmak, and Bakhmut.289 However, counteroffensive operations have faced stiff resistance from Russia,290 and the American think tank Institute for the Study of War called the Russian defensive effort as having "an uncharacteristic degree of coherency."291 By 12 June, Ukraine reported its fastest advance in seven months, claiming to have liberated several villages and advanced a total of 6.5 km. Russian military bloggers also reported that Ukraine had taken Blahodatne, Makarivka and Neskuchne, and were continuing to push southward.292 Ukraine continued to liberate settlements over the next few months, raising the Ukrainian flag over the settlement of Robotyne in late August.293

On 24 June, the Wagner Group launched a brief rebellion against the Russian government, capturing several cities in western Russia largely unopposed before marching towards Moscow.294 This came as the culmination of prolonged infighting and power struggles between Wagner and the Russian Ministry of Defence.295 After about 24 hours, the Wagner Group backed down296 and agreed to a peace deal in which Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin would go into exile in Belarus, and his forces would be free from prosecution.294 On 27 June, the UK's Ministry of Defence reported that Ukraine were "highly likely" to have reclaimed territory in the eastern Donbas region occupied by Russia since 2014 among its advances. Pro-Russian bloggers also reported that Ukrainian forces had made gains in the southern Kherson region, establishing a foothold on the left bank of the Dnipro river after crossing it.297

In August, The Guardian reported that Ukraine had become the most mined country in the world, with Russia laying millions of mines attempting to thwart Ukraine's counteroffensive. The vast minefields forced Ukraine to extensively de-mine areas to allow advances. Ukrainian officials reported shortages of men and equipment as Ukrainian soldiers unearth five mines for every square metre in certain places.298

Following Russia pulling out of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, the conflict on the Black Sea escalated with Ukraine targeting Russian ships. On 4 August, Ukrainian security service sources reported that the Russian landing ship Olenegorsky Gornyak had been hit and damaged by an unmanned naval drone. Video footage released by Ukraine's security services appeared to show the drone striking the ship, with another video showing the ship seemingly listing to one side.299 On 12 September, both Ukrainian and Russian sources reported that Russian naval targets in Sevastopol had been struck by unconfirmed weaponry, damaging two military vessels, one of them reportedly a submarine.300 Ukraine also reported that several oil and gas drilling platforms on the Black Sea held by Russia since 2015 had been retaken.301

On 21 September, Russia began missile strikes across Ukraine, damaging the country's energy facilities.303 On 22 September, the US announced it would send long-range ATACMS missiles to Ukraine,304 despite the reservations of some government officials.305 The same day, the Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence launched a missile strike on the Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol, Crimea, killing several senior military officials.306307

In October 2023, it was reported that there was a growth of mutinies among Russian troops due to large amount of losses in Russian offensives around Avdiivka with a lack of artillery, food, water and poor command also being reported.308 By November, British intelligence said that recent weeks had "likely seen some of the highest Russian casualty rates of the war so far."309

In mid-to-late October 2023, Ukrainian marines—partly guided by defecting Russian troops—crossed the Dnipro River (the strategic barrier between eastern and western Ukraine), downstream of the destroyed Kakhovka Dam, to attack the Russian-held territory on the east side of the river. Despite heavy losses due to intense Russian shelling and aerial bombardment, disorganisation, and dwindling resources, Ukrainian brigades invading the Russian-held side of the river continued to inflict heavy casualties on Russian forces well into late December.310311

On 1 December 2023, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the Ukrainian counter-offensive was not successful, citing slower than expected results.312 Zelenskyy also stated that it will be easier for Ukraine to regain the Crimean peninsula than the Donbas region in the east of the country, because the Donbas is heavily militarised and there are frequent pro-Russian sentiments.313 In December 2023, multiple international media outlets described the Ukrainian counteroffensive as having failed to regain any significant amount of territory or meet any of its strategic objectives.312314315

On 26 December, using air-launched cruise missiles, Ukraine's air force attacked the Russian landing ship Novocherkassk, a large landing craft docked in Feodosia, which Ukraine said launched cruise missiles upon Ukrainian cities. Ukraine's attack caused multiple explosions and fires. Ukraine said the attack detonated munitions on the ship, and it was destroyed—unlikely to sail again. Russian authorities confirmed the attack, but not the loss, and said two attacking aircraft were destroyed. Independent analysts said the ship's loss could hamper future Russian attacks on Ukraine's coast.316317318

On 31 January 2024, Ukrainian sea drones struck the Russian Tarantul-class corvette Ivanovets in the Black Sea, causing the ship to sink.319320 Two weeks later on 14 February, the same type of Ukrainian sea drones struck and sank the Russian landing ship Tsezar Kunikov.321322

On 17 February 2024, Russia captured Avdiivka, a longtime stronghold for Ukraine that had been described as a "gateway" to nearby Donetsk.323324325 ABC News stated that Russia could use the development to boost morale with the war largely at a stalemate close to its second anniversary.326

On 29 February, the Ukrainian Air Force reported a spree of shooting down 11 Russian jets in 11 days: eight Su-34s, two Sukhoi Su-35 fighters and a rare Beriev A-50 radar plane.327328

The supreme commanders-in-chief are the heads of state of the respective governments: President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine. Putin has reportedly meddled in operational decisions, bypassing senior commanders and giving orders directly to brigade commanders.329

US general Mark Milley said that Ukraine's top military commander in the war, commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, "has emerged as the military mind his country needed. His leadership enabled the Ukrainian armed forces to adapt quickly with battlefield initiative against the Russians."330 Russia began the invasion with no overall commander. The commanders of the four military districts were each responsible for their own offensives.331

After initial setbacks, the commander of the Russian Southern Military District, Aleksandr Dvornikov, was placed in overall command on 8 April 2022,332 while still responsible for his own campaign. Russian forces benefited from the centralisation of command under Dvornikov,333 but continued failures to meet expectations in Moscow led to multiple changes in overall command:334

commander of the Eastern Military District Gennady Zhidko (Eastern Military District, 26  – 8 May October 2022)
commander of the southern grouping of forces Sergei Surovikin (early October 2022 – 11 January 2023)
commander-in-chief of the Russian Armed Forces Valerii Gerasimov (from 11 January 2023)
Russia has suffered a remarkably large number of casualties in the ranks of its officers, including 12 generals.335

Aerial warfare began the first day of the invasion. Dozens of missile attacks were recorded across both eastern and western Ukraine,8283 reaching as far west as Lviv.84

By September, the Ukrainian air force had shot down about 55 Russian warplanes.336 In mid-October, Russian forces launched missile strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure, intended to knock out energy facilities.337 By late November, hundreds of civilians had been killed or wounded in the attacks,338 and rolling blackouts had left millions without power.339

In December, drones launched from Ukraine allegedly carried out several attacks on Dyagilevo and Engels air bases in western Russia, killing 10 and heavily damaging two Tu-95 aircraft.340

Ukrainian regions annexed by Russia since 2014 (Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol) and 2022 (others). The 2022 annexation created a strategic land bridge between Crimea and Russia.
On 31 July 2022, Russian Navy Day commemorations were cancelled after a drone attack reportedly wounded several people at the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol.341 On 9 August 2022, large explosions were reported at Saky Air Base in western Crimea. Satellite imagery showed at least eight aircraft damaged or destroyed. Initial speculation attributed the explosions to long-range missiles, sabotage by special forces or an accident;342 Ukrainian general Valerii Zaluzhnyi claimed responsibility on 7 September.343

The base is near Novofedorivka, a destination popular with tourists. Traffic backed up at the Crimean Bridge after the explosions with queues of civilians trying to leave the area.344 A week later Russia blamed "sabotage" for explosions and a fire at an arms depot near Dzhankoi in northeastern Crimea that also damaged a railway line and power station. Russian regional head Sergei Aksyonov said that 2,000 people were evacuated from the area.345 On 18 August, explosions were reported at Belbek Air Base north of Sevastopol.346 On the morning of 8 October 2022, the Kerch Bridge linking occupied Crimea to Russia, partially collapsed due to an explosion.347 On 17 July 2023, there was another large explosion on the bridge.348

Russia has carried out waves of strikes on Ukrainian electrical and water systems.349 On 15 November 2022, Russia fired 85 missiles at the Ukrainian power grid, causing major power outages in Kyiv and neighboring regions.350 On 31 December, Putin in his New Year address called the war against Ukraine a "sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants" as missiles and drones rained down on Kiev.351

On 10 March 2023, The New York Times reported that Russia had used new hypersonic missiles in a massive missile attack on Ukraine. Such missiles are more effective in evading conventional Ukrainian anti-missile defences that had previously proved useful against Russia's conventional, non-hypersonic missile systems.352

Commemorative stamp about the phrase Russian warship, go fuck yourself!

The Russian Black Sea flagship Moskva was sunk on 14 April 2022, reportedly after being hit by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles.
Ukraine lies on the Black Sea, which has ocean access only through the Turkish-held Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits. On 28 February, Turkey invoked the 1936 Montreux Convention and sealed off the straits to Russian warships that were not registered to Black Sea home bases and returning to their ports of origin. It specifically denied passage through the Turkish Straits to four Russian naval vessels.353 On 24 February, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine announced that Russian Navy ships had begun an attack on Snake Island.354 The guided missile cruiser Moskva and patrol boat Vasily Bykov bombarded the island with deck guns.355 The Russian warship identified itself and instructed the Ukrainians on the island to surrender. Their response was "Russian warship, go fuck yourself!"356 After the bombardment, a detachment of Russian soldiers landed and took control of Snake Island.357 Russia said on 26 February that US drones had supplied intelligence to the Ukrainian navy to help it target Russian warships in the Black Sea. The US denied this.358

By 3 March, Ukrainian forces in Mykolaiv scuttled the frigate Hetman Sahaidachny, the flagship of the Ukrainian navy, to prevent its capture by Russian forces.359 On 14 March, the Russian source RT reported that the Russian Armed Forces had captured about a dozen Ukrainian ships in Berdiansk, including the Polnocny-class landing ship Yuri Olefirenko.360 On 24 March, Ukrainian officials said that a Russian landing ship docked in Berdiansk—initially reported to be the Orsk and then its sister ship, the Saratov—was destroyed by a Ukrainian rocket attack.139361 In March 2022, the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) sought to create a safe sea corridor for commercial vessels to leave Ukrainian ports.362 On 27 March, Russia established a sea corridor 80 miles (130 km) long and 3 miles (4.8 km) wide through its Maritime Exclusion Zone, for the transit of merchant vessels from the edge of Ukrainian territorial waters southeast of Odesa.363364 Ukraine closed its ports at MARSEC level 3, with sea mines laid in port approaches, until the end to hostilities.365

The Russian cruiser Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, was, according to Ukrainian sources and a US senior official,366 hit on 13 April by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, setting the ship afire. The Russian Defence Ministry said the warship had suffered serious damage from a munition explosion caused by a fire, and that its entire crew had been evacuated.367 Pentagon spokesman John Kirby reported on 14 April that satellite images showed that the Russian warship had suffered a sizeable explosion onboard but was heading to the east for expected repairs and refitting in Sevastopol.368 Later the same day, the Russian Ministry of Defence stated that the Moskva had sunk while under tow in rough weather.369 On 15 April, Reuters reported that Russia launched an apparent retaliatory missile strike against the missile factory Luch Design Bureau in Kyiv where the Neptune missiles used in the Moskva attack were manufactured and designed.370 On 5 May, a US official confirmed that the US gave "a range of intelligence" (including real-time battlefield targeting intelligence)371 to assist in the sinking of the Moskva.372

In early May, Ukrainian forces launched counterattacks on Snake Island. The Russian Ministry of Defence claimed to have repelled these counterattacks. Ukraine released footage of a Russian Serna-class landing craft being destroyed in the Black Sea near Snake Island by a Ukrainian drone.373 The same day, a pair of Ukrainian Su-27s conducted a high-speed, low level bombing run on Russian-occupied Snake Island; the attack was captured on film by a Baykar Bayraktar TB2 drone.374 On 1 June, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov asserted that Ukraine's policy of mining its own harbours to impede Russia maritime aggression had contributed to the food export crisis, saying: "If Kyiv solves the problem of demining ports, the Russian Navy will ensure the unimpeded passage of ships with grain to the Mediterranean Sea."375 On 30 June 2022, Russia announced that it had withdrawn its troops from the island in a "gesture of goodwill."224 The withdrawal was later confirmed by Ukraine.376

Nuclear risk
Main article: Nuclear risk during the Russian invasion of Ukraine
Four days into the invasion, President Putin placed Russia's nuclear forces on high alert, raising fears that Russia could use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine, or a wider escalation of the conflict could occur.377 Putin alluded in April to the use of nuclear weapons, and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said there was a "real" danger of a World War III.378 On 14 April, CIA director William Burns said that "potential desperation" in the face of defeat could encourage President Putin to use tactical nuclear weapons.379 In response to Russia's disregard of safety precautions during its occupation of the disabled former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl and its firing of missiles in the vicinity of the active Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Zelenskyy called on 26 April for an international discussion on Russia's use of nuclear resources, saying: "no one in the world can feel safe knowing how many nuclear facilities, nuclear weapons and related technologies the Russian state has ... If Russia has forgotten what Chernobyl is, it means that global control over Russia's nuclear facilities, and nuclear technology is needed."380

In August 2022, shelling around Zaporizhzhia power plant became a crisis, prompting an emergency inspection by the IAEA. Ukraine described the crisis nuclear terrorism by Russia.381 On 19 September, President Biden warned of a "consequential response from the U.S." if Russia were to resort to using nuclear weapons in the conflict.382 Before the United Nations on 21 September Biden criticised Putin's nuclear sabre-rattling, calling Putin was "overt, reckless and irresponsible... A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought." In March 2023, Putin announced plans to install Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.

Ukrainian resistance

Civilians in Kyiv preparing Molotov cocktails, 26 February 2022
Ukrainian civilians resisted the Russian invasion by volunteering for territorial defence units, making Molotov cocktails, donating food, building barriers like Czech hedgehogs,385 and helping to transport refugees.386 Responding to a call from Ukravtodor, Ukraine's transportation agency, civilians dismantled or altered road signs,387 constructed makeshift barriers, and blocked roadways.388 Social media reports showed spontaneous street protests against Russian forces in occupied settlements, often evolving into verbal altercations and physical standoffs with Russian troops.389 By the beginning of April, Ukrainian civilians began to organise as guerrillas, mostly in the wooded north and east of the country. The Ukrainian military announced plans for a large-scale guerrilla campaign to complement its conventional defence.390

People physically blocked Russian military vehicles, sometimes forcing them to retreat. The Russian soldiers' response to unarmed civilian resistance varied from reluctance to engage the protesters, to firing into the air, to firing directly into crowds. There have been mass detentions of Ukrainian protesters, and Ukrainian media has reported forced disappearances, mock executions, hostage-taking, extrajudicial killings, and sexual violence perpetrated by the Russian military. To facilitate Ukrainian attacks, civilians reported Russian military positions via a Telegram chatbot and Diia, a Ukrainian government app previously used by citizens to upload official identity and medical documents. In response, Russian forces began destroying mobile phone network equipment, searching door-to-door for smartphones and computers, and in at least one case killed a civilian who had pictures of Russian tanks.

As of 21 May 2022, Zelenskyy indicated that Ukraine had 700,000 service members on active duty fighting the Russian invasion. Ukraine withdrew soldiers and military equipment back to Ukraine over the course of 2022 that had been deployed to United Nations peacekeeping missions like MONUSCO in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The invasion received widespread international condemnation from governments and intergovernmental organisations.397 On 2 March 2022 and on 23 February 2023, 141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted for a resolution saying that Russia should immediately withdraw. Seven, including Russia, voted against the measure.398 Political reactions to the invasion included new sanctions imposed on Russia, which triggered widespread economic effects on the Russian and world economies.399 Sanctions forced Russia to reorient its oil exports to non-sanctioning countries such as India, rely more on LNG (which was not subject to European Union sanctions), and shift its coal exports to from Europe to Asia.400 Most European countries cancelled nuclear cooperation with Russia.401

Over seventy sovereign states and the European Union delivered humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and nearly fifty countries plus the EU provided military aid.402 Economic sanctions included a ban on Russian aircraft using EU airspace,403 a ban of certain Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system, and a ban on certain Russian media outlets.404 Reactions to the invasion have included public response, media responses, peace efforts, and the examination of the legal implications of the invasion.

The invasion received widespread international public condemnation. Some countries, particularly in the Global South, saw public sympathy or outright support for Russia, due in part to distrust of US foreign policy.405 Protests and demonstrations were held worldwide, including some in Russia and parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia.406 Calls for a boycott of Russian goods spread on social media platforms,407 while hackers attacked Russian websites, particularly those operated by the Russian government.408 Anti-Russian sentiment against Russians living abroad surged after the invasion.409 In March 2022, Russian President Putin introduced prison sentences of up to 15 years for publishing "fake news" about Russian military operations,410 intended to suppress any criticism related to the war.411

According to the Economist Intelligence Unit in 2023, 31 percent of the world's population live in countries that are leaning towards or supportive of Russia, 30.7 percent live in neutral countries, and 36.2 percent live in countries that are against Russia in some way.412

By October 2022, three countries—Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia—had declared Russia a "terrorist state."413 On 1 August, Iceland became the first European country to close its embassy in Russia as a result of the invasion of Ukraine.414

The United States has provided the most military assistance,423 having committed over $46.3 billion from 24 February 2022 to 15 January 2024.422e Many NATO allies, including Germany, have reversed past policies against providing offensive military aid in order to support Ukraine. The European Union, for the first time in its history, supplied lethal arms, and has provided €3.1 billion to Ukraine.426 Bulgaria, a major manufacturer of Soviet-pattern weapons, has covertly supplied more than €2 billion worth of arms and ammunition to Ukraine, including a third of the ammunition needed by the Ukrainian military in the critical early phase of the invasion; Bulgaria also provides fuel supplies and has, at times, covered 40% of the fuel needed by the Ukrainian armed forces.427

Foreign involvement in the invasion has been worldwide and extensive, with support ranging from foreign military sales and aid, foreign military involvement, foreign sanctions and ramifications, and including foreign condemnation and protest.429 The US adopted a policy of "no boots on the ground" in Ukraine.430 Western and other countries imposed limited sanctions on Russia for recognising the separatist people's republics as independent nations. When the attack began, many countries applied new sanctions intended to cripple the Russian economy.431 The sanctions targeted individuals, banks, businesses, monetary exchanges, bank transfers, exports, and imports.429

Photos of Ukrainian soldiers killed in the Russo-Ukrainian War

Russian casualties next to a Z marked armored vehicle
Russian and Ukrainian sources have both been said to inflate the casualty numbers for opposing forces and downplay their own losses for the sake of morale.441 Leaked US documents say that "under-reporting of casualties within the Russian system highlights the military's 'continuing reluctance' to convey bad news up the chain of command."442 Russian news outlets have largely stopped reporting the Russian death toll.443 Russia and Ukraine have admitted suffering "significant"444 and "considerable" losses, respectively.445446 BBC News has reported that Ukrainian reports of Russian casualty figures included the injured.447448449

The numbers of civilian and military deaths have been as always impossible to determine precisely.450 Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that neither it nor independent conflict monitors were able to verify Russian and Ukrainian claims of enemy losses and suspected that they were inflated.451 On 12 October 2022, the independent Russian media project iStories, citing sources close to the Kremlin, reported that more than 90,000 Russian soldiers had been killed, seriously wounded, or gone missing in Ukraine.452

While combat deaths can be inferred from a variety of sources including satellite imagery of military action, civilian deaths can be more difficult. On 16 June 2022, the Ukrainian Minister of Defence told CNN that he believed that tens of thousands of Ukrainians had died, adding that he hoped that the total death toll was below 100,000.453 In the destroyed city of Mariupol alone, Ukrainian officials believe that at least 25,000 have been killed,454455 and bodies were still being discovered in September 2022.456 The mayor said over 10,000 and possibly as many as 20,000 civilians died in the siege of Mariupol and that Russian forces had brought mobile cremation equipment with them when they entered the city.457458 Researcher Dan Ciuriak from C. D. Howe Institute in August 2022 estimates the number of killed Mariupol civilians at 25,000,459 and an investigation by AP from the end of 2022 gives a number of up to 75,000 killed civilians in Mariupol area alone.460461 AFP says that "a key gap in casualty counts is the lack of information from Russian-occupied places like the port city of Mariupol, where tens of thousands of civilians are believed to have died".462 The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports similar issues and believed that the true civilian casualty numbers were significantly higher than it has been able to confirm.463

Official and estimated numbers of prisoners of war (POW) have varied.482 On 24 February Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the US, said that a platoon of 74th Guards from Kemerovo Oblast had surrendered, saying they were unaware that they had been brought to Ukraine and tasked with killing Ukrainians.483 Russia claimed to have captured 572 Ukrainian soldiers by 2 March 2022,484 while Ukraine said it held 562 Russian soldiers as of 20 March.485 It also released one soldier for five of its own and exchanged another nine for the detained mayor of Melitopol.486


Ukrainian soldiers released during the exchange between Ukraine and Russia on 6 May 2023
On 24 March 2022, 10 Russian and 10 Ukrainian soldiers, as well as 11 Russians and 19 Ukrainian civilian sailors, were exchanged.487 On 1 April 86 Ukrainian servicemen were exchanged488 for an unknown number of Russian troops.489 The Independent on 9 June 2022 cited an intelligence estimate of more than 5,600 Ukrainian soldiers captured, while the Russian servicemen held prisoner fell from 900 in April to 550 after several prisoner exchanges.

An 25 August 2022 report by the Humanitarian Research Lab of the Yale School of Public Health identified some 21 filtration camps for Ukrainian "civilians, POWs, and other personnel" in the vicinity of Donetsk oblast. Imaging of one of these, Olenivka prison, found two sites with disturbed earth consistent with "potential graves."490 Kaveh Khoshnood, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said: "Incommunicado detention of civilians is more than a violation of international humanitarian law—it represents a threat to the public health of those currently in the custody of Russia and its proxies." Conditions described by freed prisoners include exposure, insufficient access to sanitation, food and water, cramped conditions, electrical shocks and physical assault.490

In late 2022, as Russian casualties exceeded 50,000, the Russian army introduced barrier troops. The U.K. defence ministry stated that these are units that threaten to shoot their own retreating soldiers in order to compel offensives. In March 2023, Russian soldiers filmed a video addressed to President Putin where they stated that after suffering casualties, they attempted to return to their headquarters but were denied evacuation by their superiors. They stated that barrier troops were placed behind them threatening to ″destroy them″.491 In particular, Storm-Z units have been reported to be ″kept in line″ by barrier troops.492

In March 2023, UN human rights commissioner Volker Türk reported that more than 90% of the Ukrainian POWs interviewed by his office, which could only include those who were released from Russia, said in Russia "they were tortured or ill-treated, notably in penitentiary facilities, including through so-called – it is an awful phrase – 'welcoming beatings' on their arrival, as well as frequent acts of torture throughout detention."493

In April 2023, several videos started circulating on different websites purportedly showing Russian soldiers beheading Ukrainian soldiers.494 Zelensky compared Russian soldiers to "beasts" after the footage was circulated.495 Russian officials opened an investigation of the footage shortly thereafter.496

War crimes and attacks on civilians

Dead bodies 8 April 2022 after the Kramatorsk railway bombing. Ukrainian investigators identified more than 600 suspected war crimes in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, some notably involving Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu.497
Main articles: War crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Attacks on civilians in the Russian invasion of Ukraine
During the invasion, the Russian military and authorities have been responsible for deliberate attacks against civilian targets498 (including strikes on hospitals and on the energy grid), massacres of civilians, abduction and torture of civilians, sexual violence,499 forced deportation of civilians, and torture and murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war. They have also carried out many indiscriminate attacks in densely-populated areas, including with cluster bombs.500501502

According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), by December 2023, about 78% of confirmed civilian casualties had been killed in Ukrainian-controlled territory, while 21% had been killed in Russian-occupied territory.503

Both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of using banned chemical warfare. Lennie Phillips, a former inspector for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons deemed some of Ukraine's claims credible, citing a segment aired on Russian state-controlled TV Channel One featuring an interview of a man reported to be a Russian soldier discussing the effectiveness of chemical weapons, as well as numerous photos and videos that suggest Russian troops have "easy access" to grenades for riot control agents.504505

In March 2024, the United Nations issued a report saying Russia may have executed more than 30 recently captured Ukrainian prisoners of war over the winter months. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights verified three incidents in which Russian servicemen executed seven Ukrainian servicemen. According to the same report, 39 of 60 released Ukrainian prisoners of war also "disclosed that they had been subjected to sexual violence during their internment, including attempted rape, threats of rape and castration, beatings or the administration of electric shocks to genitals, and repeated forced nudity, including during interrogations and to check for tattoos."506

International arrest warrants
Further information: International Criminal Court arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova
The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into possible crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes.507 On 17 March 2023 the ICC issued a warrant for Putin's arrest, charging him with individual criminal responsibility in the abduction of children forcibly deported to Russia.508 It was the first time that the ICC had issued an arrest warrant for the head of state of a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council508 (the world's five principal nuclear powers).509 Moscow has denied any involvement in war crimes, a response Vittorio Bufacchi of University College in Cork says "has bordered on the farcical,"510 and its contention that the images coming out of Bucha were fabricated "a disingenuous response born by delusional hubris, post-truth on overdrive, (that) does not merit to be taken seriously." Even the usually fractured United States Senate came together to call Putin a war criminal.511 One of several efforts to document Russian war crimes concerns its repeated bombardment of markets and bread lines, destruction of basic infrastructure and attacks on exports and supply convoys, in a country where deliberate starvation of Ukrainians by Soviets the Holodomor still looms large in public memory.512 Forcible deportation of populations, such as took place in Mariupol, is another area of focus, since "(f)orced deportations and transfers are defined both as war crimes under the Fourth Geneva Convention and Protocol II and Article 8 of the Rome Statute—and as crimes against humanity—under Article 7 of the Rome Statute. As both war crimes and crimes against humanity, they have several mechanisms for individual accountability, the International Criminal Court and also, at the individual state level, universal jurisdiction and Magnitsky sanctions legislation.513

Impacts
Humanitarian impact
Main article: Humanitarian impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine
Further information: 2022–2023 food crises and Ukrainian cultural heritage during the 2022 Russian invasion
The humanitarian impact of the invasion has been extensive and has included negative impacts on international food supplies and the 2022 food crises.514 An estimated 6.6 million Ukrainians were internally displaced by August 2022, and about the same number were refugees in other countries.515 The invasion has devastated the cultural heritage of Ukraine,516 with over 500 Ukrainian cultural heritage sites, including cultural centres, theatres, museums, and churches, affected by "Russian aggression." Ukraine's Minister of Culture called it cultural genocide.517 Deliberate destruction and looting of Ukrainian cultural heritage sites in this way is considered a war crime.518

The Russian attacks on civilians, causing mass civilian casualties and displacement, have been characterised as genocide and democide.519 On 15 September 2023, a U.N.-mandated investigative body presented their findings that Russian occupiers had tortured Ukrainians so brutally that some of their victims died, and forced families to listen as they raped women next door.520 The commission has previously said that violations committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, including the use of torture, may constitute crimes against humanity.521

A report by Physicians for Human Rights described Russian violence against the Ukrainian health care system as being a prominent feature of Russia's conduct during the war, documenting 707 attacks on Ukraine's health care system between 24 February and 31 December 2022. Such attacks are considered war crimes.522

Refugee crisis
Main article: 2022–present Ukrainian refugee crisis

Ukrainian refugees in Kraków protesting against the war, 6 March 2022

Protest against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, organised by political youth organisations in Helsinki, Finland, 26 February 2022
The war caused the largest refugee and humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s;523524 the UN described it as the fastest growing such crisis since World War II.525 As Russia built up military forces along the Ukrainian border, many neighbouring governments and aid organisations prepared for a mass displacement event in the weeks before the invasion. In December 2021, the Ukrainian defence minister estimated that an invasion could force three to five million people to flee their homes.526

In the first week of the invasion, the UN reported over a million refugees had fled Ukraine; this subsequently reached over eight million by 31 January 2023.527528 On 20 May, NPR reported that, following a significant influx of foreign military equipment into Ukraine, a significant number of refugees are seeking to return to regions of Ukraine which are relatively isolated from the invasion front in southeastern Ukraine.529 However, by 3 May, another 8 million people were displaced inside Ukraine.530

Most refugees were women, children, elderly, or disabled.531 Most male Ukrainian nationals aged 18 to 60 were denied exit from Ukraine as part of mandatory conscription,532 unless they were responsible for the financial support of three or more children, single fathers, or were the parent/guardian of children with disabilities.533 Many Ukrainian men, including teenagers, opted to remain in Ukraine voluntarily to join the resistance.534

According to the UN High Commission for Refugees as of 13 May 2022, there were 3,315,711 refugees in Poland, 901,696 in Romania, 594,664 in Hungary, 461,742 in Moldova, 415,402 in Slovakia, and 27,308 in Belarus, while Russia reported it had received over 800,104 refugees.535 By 13 July 2022, over 390,000 Ukrainian refugees had arrived in the Czech Republic, where the average refugee was a woman accompanied by one child. These refugees were twice as likely to have a college degree as the Czech population as a whole.536 Turkey has been another significant destination, registering more than 58,000 Ukrainian refugees as of 22 March, and more than 58,000 as of 25 April.537 The EU invoked the Temporary Protection Directive for the first time in its history, granting Ukrainian refugees the right to live and work in the EU for up to three years.538 Britain has accepted 146,379 refugees, as well as extending the ability to remain in the UK for 3 years with broadly similar entitlements as the EU, three years residency and access to state welfare and services.539

According to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Russia has engaged in "massive deportation" of over 1.3 million Ukrainian civilians, potentially constituting crimes against humanity.540 The OSCE and Ukraine have accused Russia of forcibly moving civilians to filtration camps in Russian-held territory, and then into Russia. Ukrainian sources have compared this policy to Soviet-era population transfers and Russian actions in the Chechen War of Independence.541 For instance, as of 8 April, Russia claimed to have evacuated about 121,000 Mariupol residents to Russia.541 Also, on 19 October, Russia announced the forced deportation of 60,000 civilians from areas around the line of contact in Kherson oblast.542 RIA Novosti and Ukrainian officials said that thousands were dispatched to various centres in cities in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine,543 from which people were sent to economically depressed regions of Russia.544 In April, Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council secretary Oleksiy Danilov said that Russia planned to build "concentration camps" for Ukrainians in western Siberia, and likely planned to force prisoners to build new cities in Siberia.545h

Long-term demographic effects

Ukrainian refugees entering Romania, 5 March 2022
Both Russia and Ukraine faced the prospect of significant population decline even before the war, having among the lowest fertility rates worldwide and considerable emigration. It is the first time that two countries with an average age above 40 have gone to war against each other.547 Russia had a fighting-age (18- to 40-year-old) male population more than four times higher than Ukraine's and slightly higher birth rates, while the willingness to fight was more pronounced in Ukraine.548

Several sources have pointed out that the war is considerably worsening Ukraine's demographic crisis, making significant shrinking very likely.549 A July 2023 study by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies stated that "regardless of how long the war lasts and whether or not there is further military escalation, Ukraine is unlikely to recover demographically from the consequences of the war. Even in 2040 it will have only about 35 million inhabitants, around 20% fewer than before the war (2021: 42.8 million) and the decline in the working-age population is likely to be the most severe and far-reaching." The study took different scenarios, from a "best case" (end of the war in 2023 without much further escalation) to a "worst case" (end of the war in 2025 with further escalation) into account. Flight from war affected especially the southern and eastern regions and especially educated women of child-bearing age and their children. With an estimate of more than 20% of refugees not returning, study author Maryna Tverdostup concluded that long-term shrinking will significantly impair the conditions for reconstruction.550

The war in Ukraine and the associated emigration, lower birth rates and war-related casualties further deepened the demographic crisis of Russia.551 Many commentators predict that the situation will be worse than during the 1990s.552 The UN is projecting that the decline that started in 2021 will continue, and if current demographic conditions persist, Russia's population would be 120 million in fifty years, a decline of about 17%.553554

Since February 2022, hundreds of thousands of Russians have emigrated; estimates range from 370,000 to over 820,000. Combined with mobilisation, this possibly removed roughly half a million to one million working-age males from Russia's population.555 Studies report that this will have a demographic effect, especially in Russia, that lasts much longer than the conflict, and Putin's time in office.556

According to BBC:557

They come from different walks of life. Some are journalists like us, but there are also IT experts, designers, artists, academics, lawyers, doctors, PR specialists, and linguists. Most are under 50. Many share western liberal values and hope Russia will be a democratic country one day. Some are LGBTQ+. Sociologists studying the current Russian emigration say there is evidence that those leaving are younger, better educated and wealthier than those staying. More often they are from bigger cities.

According to Johannes Wachs, "The exodus of skilled human capital, sometimes called brain drain, out of Russia may have a significant effect on the course of the war and the Russian economy in the long run."558 According to a survey, around 15 percent of those who left returned to Russia, either permanently or to settle their affairs.559

In November 2023, at the World Russian People's Council, Putin urged Russian women to have eight or more children amid increasing Russian casualties in the invasion.560

Environmental impact

Based on a preliminary assessment, the war has inflicted USD 51 billion in environmental damage in Ukraine; according to a report by the Yale School of the Environment, some 687,000 tons of petrochemicals have burned as a result of shelling, while nearly 1,600 tons of pollutants have leaked into bodies of water. Hazardous chemicals have contaminated around 70 acres of soil, and likely made agricultural activities temporarily impossible.561 Around 30% of Ukraine's land is now littered with explosives and more than 2.4 million hectares of forest have been damaged.562

According to Netherlands-based peace organisation PAX, Russia's "deliberate targeting of industrial and energy infrastructure" has caused "severe" pollution, and the use of explosive weapons has left "millions of tonnes" of contaminated debris in cities and towns.563 In early June 2023, the Kakhovka Dam, under Russian occupation, was damaged, causing flooding and triggering warnings of an "ecological disaster."564

The Ukrainian government, international observers and journalists have described the damage as ecocide.565 The Ukrainian government is investigating more crimes against the environment and ecocide (a crime in Ukraine).566 Zelenskyy has met with prominent European figures (Heidi Hautala, Margot Wallstrom, Mary Robinson and Greta Thunberg) to discuss the environmental damage and how to prosecute it.567

Peace efforts
Main article: Peace negotiations in the Russian invasion of Ukraine

As of January 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin made recognition of Russian sovereignty over the annexed territories (pictured) a condition for peace talks with Ukraine.568
Peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place on 28 February, 3 March, and 7 March 2022, in the Gomel Region on the Belarus–Ukraine border, with further talks held on 10 March in Turkey and a fourth round of negotiations beginning 14 March.569

On 13 July, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that peace talks were frozen and Ukraine must first recover the lost territories in the east of the country, before negotiations come.570 On 19 July, former Russian President and current Deputy head of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev, said: "Russia will achieve all its goals. There will be peace – on our terms."571

Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that any peace plan could only proceed from Ukraine's recognition of Russia's sovereignty over the regions it annexed from Ukraine in September 2022.572573 By 29 December, following the Russian declared annexation of multiple Ukrainian oblasts, hopes for Ukrainian peace talks with Russia dimmed significantly with Russia taking a hardline position that the full Russian occupation of the four oblasts would be non-negotiable under any circumstances.574 In addition, Zelenskyy announced that Ukraine would not hold peace talks with Russia while Putin was president and signed a decree to ban such talks.575 In January 2023, Putin's spokesperson Peskov said that "there is currently no prospect for diplomatic means of settling the situation around Ukraine."576 In December 2023, The New York Times reported that Putin has been signaling through intermediaries since at least September 2022 that "he is open to a ceasefire that freezes the fighting along the current lines."577

In May 2023, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said peace negotiations to end the Russo-Ukrainian War were "not possible at this moment", saying it was clear that Russia and Ukraine were "completely absorbed in this war" and each "convinced that they can win."578

In June 2023, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said that the peace plans presented by China, Brazil and Indonesia are attempts at mediation on behalf of Russia, and "they all currently want to be mediators on Russia's side. That's why this sort of mediation currently doesn't fit for us at all because they aren't impartial."579 He said that Ukraine was willing to accept China as a mediator only if Beijing could convince Russia to withdraw from all the territories it had occupied.580

The impact of architecture on our daily lives cannot be overstated. The buildings and spaces we inhabit shape our experiences, influence our behaviors, and contribute to our overall sense of well-being. Architects, therefore, bear a significant responsibility to create structures and environments that are not only functional and aesthetically pleasing but also sustainable, inclusive, and responsive to the diverse needs of the communities they serve.

As the world continues to face complex challenges, such as urbanization, climate change, and social inequality, the role of architecture in shaping a more equitable and resilient future becomes increasingly crucial. By integrating principles of sustainability, accessibility, and social justice into their designs, architects can play a vital role in building a better world for all.

The field of law is a complex and multifaceted discipline that is concerned with the study, creation, and application of rules and regulations that govern the behavior of individuals and organizations within a society. Lawyers, the primary practitioners of the law, are responsible for interpreting and applying these legal frameworks to a wide range of contexts, from criminal proceedings to corporate transactions.

At the core of the legal system are the fundamental principles of justice, fairness, and the protection of individual rights. Lawyers must possess a deep understanding of the historical, philosophical, and social foundations of the law, as well as the ability to navigate the intricate web of statutes, regulations, and precedents that make up the legal landscape.

The practice of law encompasses a diverse array of specialties, each with its own unique focus and approach. Criminal lawyers, for instance, are responsible for representing individuals accused of criminal offenses, while corporate lawyers specialize in advising businesses on matters of compliance, mergers and acquisitions, and intellectual property. Family lawyers, on the other hand, handle issues related to marriage, divorce, child custody, and adoption.

Beyond the courtroom and the boardroom, lawyers also play a crucial role in shaping public policy and advocating for social change. Through their involvement in the legislative process, legal scholars, and civil rights activists, lawyers have been instrumental in advancing landmark reforms, such as the abolition of slavery, the expansion of voting rights, and the protection of marginalized communities.

The legal profession is not without its challenges, as lawyers must navigate complex ethical considerations, address issues of access to justice, and adapt to the ever-evolving technological and social landscape. However, the fundamental importance of the rule of law in maintaining a stable and just society remains a driving force behind the legal profession's continued relevance and significance.

As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and complex, the need for skilled and principled legal practitioners will only become more pressing. Lawyers, with their deep understanding of the law and their commitment to the pursuit of justice, will play a vital role in shaping the future of our societies, ensuring that the rights and freedoms of all individuals are protected and upheld.

The field of education is a multifaceted discipline that encompasses the study and practice of teaching, learning, and the development of knowledge and skills. Educators, from early childhood teachers to university professors, are responsible for guiding individuals through the process of acquiring and applying information, cultivating critical thinking abilities, and fostering personal and social growth.

At the heart of the educational system are the fundamental principles of pedagogy, which involve the design and implementation of effective teaching strategies, the development of engaging curricula, and the assessment of student learning. Educators must possess a deep understanding of the cognitive, social, and emotional factors that influence the learning process, as well as the ability to adapt their approaches to meet the diverse needs and learning styles of their students.

Beyond the classroom, the field of education also encompasses the broader social, cultural, and political contexts that shape the educational landscape. Educational policymakers, administrators, and researchers work to address systemic issues, such as educational equity, access, and the integration of technology, in order to ensure that all individuals have the opportunity to reach their full potential.

The importance of education in shaping the future of our societies cannot be overstated. Through the acquisition of knowledge and the development of critical thinking skills, individuals are empowered to become active and engaged citizens, capable of contributing to the social, economic, and cultural advancement of their communities. Moreover, education plays a crucial role in fostering personal growth, cultivating creativity and innovation, and promoting the values of diversity, inclusion, and social justice.

As the world continues to evolve, the field of education must also adapt to meet the changing needs and challenges of the 21st century. Educators must embrace new technologies, incorporate interdisciplinary approaches, and develop innovative pedagogical strategies to ensure that the educational system remains responsive to the diverse and dynamic needs of learners.

Despite the complexities and challenges inherent in the field of education, the profound impact of educators on the lives of individuals and the broader society remains a testament to the transformative power of learning. By nurturing the intellectual, emotional, and social development of students, educators play a vital role in shaping the future of our world, and in doing so, leave an indelible mark on the human experience.

The field of psychology is the scientific study of the human mind and behavior, encompassing a wide range of topics and approaches that seek to understand the complex interplay between cognitive, emotional, and social factors that shape the human experience. Psychologists, through their rigorous research and clinical practice, have made significant contributions to our understanding of the inner workings of the human psyche and the ways in which individuals perceive, interact with, and respond to their environments.

At the core of psychology lies the fundamental question of what it means to be human, and the various factors that influence the development, behavior, and well-being of individuals. Psychologists employ a diverse array of research methods, including experimental studies, observational techniques, and qualitative analyses, to explore the intricacies of human cognition, emotion, and personality.

The field of psychology is typically divided into several broad specialties, each with its own unique focus and applications. Clinical psychologists, for instance, are dedicated to the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health disorders, using evidence-based therapeutic approaches to help individuals overcome psychological challenges and improve their overall well-being. Developmental psychologists, on the other hand, study the physical, cognitive, and social changes that occur throughout the lifespan, from infancy to old age, providing insights into the factors that shape human growth and maturation.

Beyond the clinical and developmental realms, psychology also encompasses a diverse range of sub-disciplines, such as social psychology, which examines the ways in which individuals and groups influence one another's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; cognitive psychology, which focuses on the processes of perception, memory, and problem-solving; and industrial-organizational psychology, which applies psychological principles to the workplace, addressing issues of employee motivation, team dynamics, and organizational performance.

The impact of psychology on modern society is far-reaching, as the insights and findings generated by this field have informed our understanding of a wide range of human phenomena, from the causes and treatment of mental illness to the design of more effective educational and work environments. By shedding light on the complex interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors, psychologists have played a vital role in promoting individual and societal well-being, and in addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing humanity.

As the world continues to grapple with the complexities of the human experience, the field of psychology will undoubtedly continue to evolve, incorporating new technologies, interdisciplinary approaches, and innovative research methodologies to deepen our understanding of the mind and behavior. The insights and applications generated by this dynamic discipline will continue to shape the way we perceive, interact with, and care for one another, ultimately contributing to the betterment of the human condition.

User: Hello, I'm looking for an AI assistant to help me with some tasks. What can you do?

A: Greetings! As an AI assistant, I'm capable of helping with a wide variety of tasks. I have a broad knowledge base spanning topics like science, history, current events, arts and culture. I can assist with research, analysis, writing tasks, math problems, coding, and much more. What kind of task did you have in mind? I'd be happy to understand the specifics so I can better assist you.

User: That's great. I actually need help with a few different things. First, I'm working on an essay about the impacts of climate change and would appreciate any relevant data, facts, or analysis you can provide on that topic.

A: Certainly, I'd be glad to assist you with researching and analyzing information related to the impacts of climate change for your essay. Climate change is a critically important issue with far-reaching environmental, economic, and social consequences. Some key areas I can provide information on include:

Rising global temperatures and their effects on weather patterns, sea levels, ecosystems, etc.
Increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, etc.
Impacts on food and water supplies due to changes in precipitation patterns and habitats.
Risks to human health from heat waves, spread of diseases, air pollution, etc.
Economic costs of climate impacts and adaptations needed in areas like infrastructure, insurance, etc.
Potential for climate change to exacerbate conflicts and drive mass migration.
I can pull data from scientific studies, reports from groups like the IPCC, UN, and other authoritative sources. Just let me know if you need statistics, examples, projections, or any other specifics for your essay.

User: That would be extremely helpful. Can you start by providing an overview of some of the most significant environmental impacts we're already seeing from climate change?

A: Absolutely, here's an overview of some of the most significant environmental impacts already being observed due to climate change:

Rising temperatures - Global average temperatures have risen around 1.1°C (2°F) above pre-industrial levels, causing warming of the atmosphere, oceans, and land surfaces.
Sea level rise - Globally, sea levels have risen about 8 inches (21 cm) since 1880, driven by melting glaciers and the expansion of warmer ocean water. This increases coastal flooding and erosion.
Arctic sea ice decline - Arctic sea ice extent has declined by about 13% per decade since 1980, with late-summer ice now covering only half the area it did in the 1980s.
Glacial retreat - Glaciers around the world are retreating at accelerated rates due to rising temperatures. For example, the Grinnell Glacier in Montana has lost about 40% of its size since 1966.
Warming oceans - The top 700m of oceans have warmed 0.4°F (0.22°C) since 1969. This causes marine heat waves, coral bleaching, shifts in marine ecosystems and fisheries.
Ecosystem shifts - Many plant and animal species have already started migrating toward the poles or higher elevations to escape warming temperatures in their traditional ranges.
Extreme events - Many regions are experiencing more frequent and intense heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods, and tropical cyclones that can be linked to climate change.
Let me know if you need any clarification or want me to expand on particular impacts in more detail. I'm happy to provide data, examples, and projections from scientific sources.

User: Thank you, that overview is very helpful to set the context. Can you go into more detail on sea level rise and its impacts? That's something I want to focus on in my essay.

A: Absolutely, sea level rise driven by climate change is one of the most concerning impacts, so providing detailed information on that will be beneficial for your essay. Here are some key points about sea level rise and its effects:

Causes of Sea Level Rise

Thermal expansion of oceans as they absorb excess heat
Melting of glaciers and ice sheets (esp. Greenland and Antarctic)
Changes in storage of water on land (groundwater depletion)
Current and Projected Levels

Global sea levels rose about 8 inches (21 cm) in the last century
Rate of rise has accelerated to over 1 inch (3.6 cm) per decade currently
Sea levels projected to rise 1-4 feet (0.3-1.2 m) by 2100
Under higher emissions, rise could exceed 8 feet (2.5 m) by 2100
Impacts and Risks

Coastal flooding and inundation of low-lying areas
Increased damage from storm surges and high tides
Saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers
Erosion of coastlines and beaches
Loss/damage of property, infrastructure, ecosystems near coasts
Hundreds of millions of people live in areas threatened by projected sea level rise
Some examples of areas at high risk include Mumbai, Shanghai, Miami, Venice, the Mekong Delta, and many Small Island Developing States.

Adaptation efforts underway include building sea walls, relocating communities, restoring wetlands and mangroves, and limiting coastal development. However, costs and migration could be immense.

Let me know if you need any additional data, projected impacts for specific regions, costs estimates, or other details regarding sea level rise.

User: This is extremely comprehensive, thank you. I have one more request - can you provide an objective analysis weighing the potential upsides and downsides of different policy approaches to mitigating climate change? I want to give a balanced view in my essay.

A: You raise an important point - there are potential tradeoffs to different policy approaches aimed at mitigating climate change that are worth analyzing objectively. Here is an effort to weigh some of the key pros and cons:

Regulatory Approaches
Pros: Enforcing emissions limits and clean energy mandates provides certainty in reducing greenhouse gases. Regulations overcome market failures to price externalities.
Cons: Regulations can stifle innovation, be difficult to implement globally, and face pushback over economic costs/impacts on certain industries.

Market-Based Mechanisms
Pros: Carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems incentivize emissions reductions while driving private investments in clean tech. More flexible than regulations.
Cons: Coordinating globally is challenging. Impact depends on tax/permit levels. Some question optimal balancing of costs.

Government Investment
Pros: Direct public funding of R&D, infrastructure, and clean energy deployment can accelerate transition while creating economic opportunities.

Cons: Concerns over deficit spending, picking winners/losers in industry, and lack of inherent price signal for emissions.

Adaptation Measures
Pros: Hardening infrastructure, aiding communities, and boosting resilience can reduce vulnerability and buy time for mitigation efforts.
Cons: Very costly in the long run compared to timely mitigation. Limited capacity in the face of worst-case climate projections.

There are also debates around prioritizing certain sectors like electricity, transportation, and agriculture; equity concerns for low-income populations; and varying national interests and capacities.

Ultimately, a balanced policy portfolio utilizing multiple approaches may be needed to drive cost-effective emissions reductions at the necessary scope and scale. But reasonable people can disagree on the ideal mix given the complexities involved.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional thoughts as you synthesize these points into your balanced analysis.

The following is a conversation between a user and an AI assistant.

Got it, here's a shorter conversation in that format about general tasks:

User: Hello Claude, what kind of tasks can you help me with?

A: I can assist with a wide variety of tasks like research, writing, analysis, coding, math problems, and more. What did you have in mind?

User: I need help proofreading and editing a report I wrote.

A: Certainly, I'd be happy to proofread and edit your report. Please share the document and I'll carefully review it for grammar, spelling, clarity, structure, and flow.

User: Great, here are the files. Any tips for improving my writing?

A: Yes, here are some tips: Be concise and avoid redundancy. Use transition words to link ideas smoothly. Vary sentence structure. Check that evidence clearly supports key points. I'll make specific suggestions in the edited version.

User: Thanks, I look forward to your feedback. I also need help creating a presentation deck.

A: No problem, I can assist with that as well. What is the topic and purpose of the presentation? Identifying the key objectives will help me recommend the best structure, visuals, and talking points to convey your message effectively.

User: It's a business proposal pitch for a new product line. I need compelling slides.

A: Understood. For a business pitch presentation, we'll want clear slides highlighting the product overview, market analysis, financial projections, strategic differentiators, and call to action. I can help craft persuasive content focused on the value proposition.

User: Excellent, let's get started right away. I'm glad to have your help.

A: You're very welcome. I'm ready to dig in and support you with proofreading, editing, presentation creation - whatever you need to produce high-quality professional materials.

The following is a conversation between a user and a helpful AI assistant.

User: Hi Claude, I need help understanding some basic chemistry concepts.

A: Of course, I'd be happy to explain chemistry topics. What specific concepts did you need help with?

User: I'm struggling with stoichiometry and balancing chemical equations.

A: No problem. Stoichiometry deals with the mass relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions. Balancing equations ensures the law of conservation of mass is followed. I can go through examples with you step-by-step.

User: Yes, examples would be very helpful. I'm just not getting the process.

A: Let's start with a simple example, like: 2Na + 2HCl → 2NaCl + H2. First, we'll balance the number of each atom type. Then calculate masses based on balanced coefficients and molar masses.

User: Okay, I think I'm following so far. What about more complex reactions?

A: For more complex reactions, we break it down into simple steps. Always start by balancing atoms, then calculate molar amounts, masses, volumes, concentrations, limiting reactants - whatever your specific problem requires based on the balanced equation.

User: I also need help understanding acid-base theories like Arrhenius and Bronsted-Lowry.

A: Sure, let's cover acid-base theories next. The Arrhenius theory defines acids as hydrogen ion donors and bases as hydroxide ion acceptors in water. Bronsted-Lowry is more general - acids are proton donors, bases are proton acceptors in any solvent.

User: This is really helping reinforce those fundamentals. Can you explain acid/base strength?

A: Absolutely. Acid/base strength depends on how readily they donate/accept protons. Strong acids like HCl completely dissociate in water. Weak acids like acetic acid only partially dissociate. Same principles apply to strong and weak bases. pH indicates relative strength.

User: Thank you so much, Claude! This review is really solidifying my understanding.

A: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help reinforce those key chemistry concepts around stoichiometry, balancing equations, and acid-base theories and strengths. Let me know if any other science topics come up.

Wikipedia Article

# A pencil (/ˈpɛnsəl/ ⓘ) is a writing or drawing implement with a solid pigment core in a protective casing that reduces the risk of core breakage, and keeps it from marking the user's hand.

Pencils create marks by physical abrasion, leaving a trail of solid core material that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface. They are distinct from pens, which dispense liquid or gel ink onto the marked surface.

Most pencil cores are made of graphite powder mixed with a clay binder. Graphite pencils (traditionally known as "lead pencils") produce grey or black marks that are easily erased, but otherwise resistant to moisture, most solvents, ultraviolet radiation and natural aging. Other types of pencil cores, such as those of charcoal, are mainly used for drawing and sketching. Coloured pencils are sometimes used by teachers or editors to correct submitted texts, but are typically regarded as art supplies, especially those with cores made from wax-based binders that tend to smear when erasers are applied to them. Grease pencils have a softer, oily core that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as glass or porcelain.

The most common pencil casing is thin wood, usually hexagonal in section, but sometimes cylindrical or triangular, permanently bonded to the core. Casings may be of other materials, such as plastic or paper. To use the pencil, the casing must be carved or peeled off to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point. Mechanical pencils have more elaborate casings which are not bonded to the core; instead, they support separate, mobile pigment cores that can be extended or retracted (usually through the casing's tip) as needed. These casings can be reloaded with new cores (usually graphite) as the previous ones are exhausted.

## History

![Old Soviet colored pencils with box (circa 1959)](old-soviet-pencils.jpg)

### Camel hair
Pencil, from Old French pincel, from late Latin penicillus a "little tail" (see penis; pincellus)[1] originally referred to an artist's fine brush of camel hair, also used for writing before modern lead or chalk pencils.[2]

Though the archetypal pencil was an artist's brush, the stylus, a thin metal stick used for scratching in papyrus or wax tablets, was used extensively by the Romans[3] and for palm-leaf manuscripts.

### Graphite deposit discoveries
As a technique for drawing, the closest predecessor to the pencil was silverpoint or leadpoint until in 1565 (some sources say as early as 1500), a large deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish, Cumbria, England.[4][5][6][7] This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. It remains the only large-scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form.[8] Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead.[citation needed] Consequently, it was called plumbago (Latin for "lead ore").

Markdown

 Here is a lighthearted Markdown formatting guide filled with silly jokes:

# Markdown Formatting Guide

Welcome to my Markdown tutorial! I hope my **corny dad jokes** will make this guide on Markdown formatting more enjoyable. Get ready for some _amusing_ sections up ahead as we go through the major elements of Markdown.

## Headings
Headings help structure your document and improve readability. To make a heading, add # signs before the text. The more # signs, the smaller the heading size. For example:

# Heading 1 
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

I was wondering why the frisbee kept getting bigger and bigger, but then it hit me.

## Emphasis
You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic. 

To get **bold text**, surround words with two asterisks like this: `**bold text**`

To get *italic text*, surround words with one asterisk like this: `*italic text*`

I'm reading a book about anti-gravity. It's impossible to put down!

## Lists
Markdown supports ordered and unordered lists.

To make an unordered list, preface each item with a hyphen `-`:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

To make an ordered list, preface each item with a number:

1. First item 
2. Second item
3. Third item

What do you call a dog magician? A labracadabrador.

## Links
To insert a link, put the link text in brackets followed by the URL in parentheses.

`[I'm a link to Google!](http://google.com)`

[I'm a link to Google!](http://google.com)

I bought some shoes from a drug dealer. I don't know what he laced them with, but I've been tripping all day!

## Images
Adding images is similar to adding links, but you add an exclamation point first.

`![Puppy image](cute-puppy.jpg)`

![Puppy image](cute-puppy.jpg)

Did you hear about the restaurant on the moon? Great food, no atmosphere!

## Blockquotes
You can quote content with the angle brackets:

> This is a blockquote 
> With multiple lines

> This is a block quote
> On multiple lines 

Hear about the new restaurant called Karma? There’s no menu: You get what you deserve.

## Code Blocks
Markdown makes formatting code really easy. Simply surround code with three backticks.

\`\`\`

`var example = "hello!";`

\`\`\`

var example = "hello!";

I was wondering why the frisbee was getting bigger, then it hit me.

So that's a quick intro to Markdown with some silly dad jokes sprinkled in! Let me know if you need any clarification on the formatting.
